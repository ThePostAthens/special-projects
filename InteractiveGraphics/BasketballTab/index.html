        <h1>Saul Phillips</h1>
        <div id="column">
        <p> If you walk into Ohio coach Saul Phillips' office in The Convo, a large plasma screen TV playing college basketball can be seen over your left shoulder.</p> 
        <p> There's a treadmill pushed against the far wall with a damp towel hugging its handles. A large window illuminates the room and displays a busy Richland Avenue.</p>
        <p> Phillips isn't in his office, but the voice of college basketball commentator Dick Vitale can be heard from a few feet outside.</p>
        <p>"The theory I have is that I sit around and think about basketball 18 hours a day," Phillips said.</p></div>
