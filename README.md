        <p>Here lies the special projects written and produced by students in our newsroom.</p>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>To create your own new special project:
        <ol>
            <li>Clone thepostathens.github.io to your desktop </li>
            <li>Navigate to the "Working-SpecialProject" and select "New Template" </li>
            <li>Duplicate it </li>
            <li> Rename it <li>  This will be the URL of the story/landing page </li>
           <li>When you're done naming the project, move it to the "SpecialProjects" folder - This allows the project to go live</li>
            <li>Open the GitHub application and type in a summary of what you did - You can do this throughout your time working on the project so you can go back to certain places you saved</li>
            <li>Make sure to press "push origin" every time you make changes and write a summary</li>
            <li>When you are finished, make sure there are no changes left and press "fetch origin"</li>
    </ul>
            </p>
