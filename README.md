   <ol>
      <li>Clone thepostathens.github.io to your desktop </li>
      <li>Navigate to the <strong>Working-SpecialProject</strong> and select <strong>New Template</strong> </li>
      <ul>
         <li>Duplicate it </li>
         <li> Rename it -This will be the URL of the story/landing page </li>
      </ul>
      <li>When you're done naming the project, move it to the <strong>SpecialProjects</strong> folder - This allows the project to go live</li>
      <li>Open the GitHub application and type in a summary of what you did - You can do this throughout your time working on the project so you can go back to certain places you saved</li>
      <li>Make sure to press "push origin" every time you make changes and write a summary</li>
      <li>When you are finished, make sure there are no changes left and press "fetch origin"</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>Style Guide</h2>
   <h3>Fonts:</h3>
   <p>The Post has two main fonts for special projects. <strong>Montserrat</strong> is the standard sans serif font, while       Playfair Display is the serif font. In some  cases, it's okay to use different fonts for design purposes with good reason.</p>
   <p>Montserrat</p>
   ```css
font-family: "Montserrat", Arial, sans-serif;
```
   
   <p>Playfair Display"
   ```css
font-family: "Playfair Display", Georgia, serif;
```
