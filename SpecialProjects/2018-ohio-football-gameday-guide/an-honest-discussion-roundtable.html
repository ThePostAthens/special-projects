        <p>Ohio will kick off the 2018 season Sept. 1 at Peden Stadium against Howard. The Post’s football beat writers Spencer Holbrook and Pete Nakos answered some questions about the matchup.</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Howard’s quarterback is Cam Newton’s brother, Caylin. How does he compare to his big brother? Does he present a challenge to the Bobcats?</p>
        
        <p><b>Spencer: </b> Caylin Newton is obviously not going to win the Heisman Trophy or become the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. He also is very unlikely to win an NFL MVP. Other than that, they’re pretty similar. Caylin is very athletic and can make plays, regardless of his situation, and he could prove to be a handful for an inexperienced Bobcat front seven.</p>
        
        <p><b>Pete: </b>Caylin is what completes coach Mike London’s offense at Howard. The odd formation the Bison operate their offense out of is perfect for an FCS team with a dual-threat quarterback. At times Saturday, there will be three running backs in the backfield, and we’ll see Caylin throw the ball deep. He’s a threat that the Bobcats need to be cautious about.</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Howard runs an odd-man front instead of the usual four-man front. How will that affect Ohio’s run game?</p>

Ouellette stiff arms Kent State's Juantez McRae during the Bobcats' game against the Golden Flashes on October 21.</p> </div>
        
        <p><b>Spencer: </b>It could be tricky. Luckily, the Bobcats have an experienced offensive line that has been through the ropes of college football long enough to figure it out. Yes, Ohio’s been practicing for months against its own defense, which runs a four-man front. And the Bobcats have had to adapt. But Nathan Rourke and A.J. Ouellette are good runners who can find holes in any defense. Howard won’t be an exception.</p>
        
        <p><b>Pete: </b>Ohio has practiced against its own defense throughout camp, which operates out of a 4-3 front. Don’t be surprised if it takes a few drives for the Bobcats to adjust, but with an experienced offensive line and a solid backfield, they should be fine. The only trouble may come from Brett Kitrell’s the first start at center. Hopefully he communicates well with the rest of the line when he sees the front.</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Ohio has high expectations for the game and the season. How do they avoid a tough letdown?</p>
        
        <p><b>Spencer: </b>I don’t really think there’s an opportunity for a letdown in Week 1 against Howard, but I’ve been wrong before. Obviously, everyone can point to the <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/09/ohio-recap">Texas State debacle</a> two years ago and talk themselves into an Ohio loss to Howard. But this team looks different. Rourke and Ouellette are back behind an experienced offensive line. Ohio has the best secondary in the MAC. A letdown isn’t likely.</p>
        
        <p><b>Pete: </b>I was at that Texas State game, and I’ll tell you that nobody saw it coming. I don’t think it will be a debacle or a loss, but I wouldn’t be shocked if it’s 14-7 Ohio entering halftime. We’ve seen close games against FCS teams before, such as Southeastern Louisiana three years ago. There won’t be a letdown, though.</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>What will the final score be? Why?</p>
        
        <p><b>Spencer: </b>I think Ohio wins, <b>55-17.</b> The Bobcats’ offense might start slowly against that odd front from Howard, but it’ll right the ship in time to still blow out the Bison. Howard’s defense was terrible last season, and I expect big things from the Ohio offense.</p>
        
        <p><b>Pete: </b>Ohio wins, <b>48-24.</b> The Bobcats get off to a fast start and pull their starters early, maybe even before the end of the first half. But Caylin Newton won’t let Howard be shut out or embarrassed. He’ll make it a semi-interesting game in the second half. </p>
