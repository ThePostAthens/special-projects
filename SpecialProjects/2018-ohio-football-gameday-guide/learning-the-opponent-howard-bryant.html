        <p>The Post's sports editor Spencer Holbrook spoke with Howard Sports Information Director Derek Bryant over the phone to find out more about the Bison, who will travel to Athens for a matchup with Ohio on Saturday.</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Howard had some early success last season, with beating UNLV. Is that the same mindset they’ll take into these FBS games now that they have a win under their belt?</p>
        
        <p><b>Bryant: </b> “It’s definitely something that they have confidence that they can compete with teams at the FBS level. Obviously, last year, no one expected it. For the team to pull off that victory, but going into this year, the team is confident that this year they obviously can compete with FBS teams and prepare themselves for conference play as well.”</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>A large part of the success came from the quarterback, Caylin Newton. What are the expectations around him this year?</p>
        
        <p><b>Bryant: </b>“From what I’ve been around and hearing, Caylin had a phenomenal year last year as a freshman. Going into this year, they expect more from him in terms of kind of taking the reins off and letting him have a little more freedom of changing plays at the line and so forth. I think that going into this year, expectations are obviously there, but he’s ready for the challenge.”</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Talk a little about the defense. I know a lot of the talk has been on the offense and how good it can be with Caylin, but I haven’t seen a lot about the defense. Can you go into a little detail about the defense?</p>

        <p><b>Bryant: </b>“The majority of the team last year was a bunch of freshman — starting. A lot of those freshman were on the defensive side as well. This year, a lot of them have a lot of playing time under their belt now, including some of those players played in that UNLV game last year. The team has brought in a lot of talent, in regards to the recruiting class. The secondary is led by Bryan Cook, who had a team-high four interceptions last year. It’s not just him as well, Tye Freeland, safety, on the other side of Cook is Aaron Walker, that secondary is probably their strength, in my opinion. The front seven is led by Aaron Motley, who had a team-high five sacks last year, and he’s just a sophomore. The linebacking corps is going to be led by a slew of seniors. Marcellus Allison is one of the young men who will be in that linebacking corp, recently he was named to the all-conference preseason team. There is obviously some other freshman that they’ve recruited that they’ve brought in on that defensive side. The defense is led by Vince Brown, who is a 2018 College Football Hall of Fame finalist. The defense will be better going into this year.”</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Do you think a lot of those freshmen being able to play last year and having some success, does that bode well going into a pretty big game against Ohio?</p>
        
        <p><b>Bryant: </b>“Yes. Coach (Mike) London told me this a few days ago, I believe he said 65 percent of the roster consists of freshmen and sophomore. So a lot of those sophomores that got the playing time last year have stepped up into that leadership role.  Obviously Caylin Newton is one of them, along with Bryan Cook on the defensive side of the ball, so absolutely.”</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Do you think that it is an advantage for Howard, playing against FBS, even Power 5 opponents, having Mike London, whose been around these programs before, with huge schools like Virginia and Maryland.</p>
        
        <p><b>Bryant: </b>“Yes, absolutely. I think it’s something, in terms of football and just in general, you just got to be better on that one day. Talentwise, that other team may be better, but one that one day, just be better than that team on that one day. Coach London has brought together a superb coaching staff, I talked about Coach Brown, on the offensive side coach Brennan Marion his style of offense, they call it “go-go offense” — up-tempo, want to keep the defense guessing. Obviously, they have a lot of assistants that went on to play at the professional level. Cato June is one of them, Ras-I Dowling was drafted in the second round by the New England Patriots, coach Brown played for the New England Patriots. He’s definitely built a coaching staff that has experiences, so yes, it is an advantage.”</p>
        
        <p><b>Q: </b>Has there been a lot of talking about preparing for Nathan Rourke. He’s one of the better quarterbacks in the MAC, and also in the Group of 5. He’s kind of a handful, have you heard talk about preparing a little more than they normally would for a quarterback.</p>
        
        <p><b>Bryant: </b>“I haven’t. This morning we had our weekly MEAC teleconference and there was a question addressed in regards in I believe the running back, he had over a 1,000 yards last year. The quarterback, I assume you’re referring to the one whose nickname is 'Air Canada.' So, in terms of a game plan, I do not know, but I am sure they are aware of the high-explosive offense they can put up. Just in general, I know the MAC is known for putting up points. To answer your question, I do not have any knowledge of a game plan, but I am sure they are aware of it.”</p>
