            <p>Thank you for continuing to support and read The Post. As I write this, it is bittersweet. My four years at The Post are coming to an end, and I can’t think of a better way to sum it up than with this photo edition. Working for The Post these past four years has been a whirlwind of learning, emotions and a lot of photographs. I’ve grown a lot thanks to The Post, and I cannot wait to see how much the photo staff will continue to grow after this year. </p>

            <p>While this might not have been how the photo staff wanted to say goodbye to this year, with everyone spread out in different cities and states, this is our reality again. Despite not being in Athens, the photo staff still put in the work and created some amazing projects, which can be seen in “Away from Athens.” I am immensely proud of this photo staff and all of the work they have done. </p>

            <p>For the past two years, I have had the pleasure of working with Nate Swanson as my photo editor. As he steps into the role of director of photography, I know he is going to continue to grow and mold the photo staff into something great. Nate, thank you for always keeping my head on straight, pulling out some amazing photographs at the last second and being there for me always. I know you are going to do some great things with this staff, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for you. </p>

            <p>To the readers of The Post, thank you! Without each and every one, we would not have been able to do this each week. Working for The Post has made my college experience something I will never forget. Photographing each assignment brought someone new into my life, and I will hold onto the memories that The Post has brought to me. </p>

            <p>This photo edition is not at all what we envisioned starting the year. We had hoped to have our staff back on campus. Unfortunately, the pandemic had other plans. Despite everything, we were still able to produce great content this year, and it reflects in this edition of The Post. Please enjoy this special edition of The Post, and enjoy all of the work that our staff, near and far, worked to produce this year. </p>
