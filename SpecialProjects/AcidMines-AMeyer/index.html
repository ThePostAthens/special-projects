            <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>race Southeast Ohio’s history of coalmining, and it’s not entirely difficult to understand how the waterways of Appalachia started to seep a noticeable, dull rust color. The difficulty is in determining whether the acid mine drainage in the Sunday Creek Watershed is a permanent stain.</p>
            <p>For decades, the iron-rich, contaminated water has drained from abandoned coal mines, and an Ohio University student could come across it if he or she drove about 20 minutes north of Athens to Truetown or Corning.</p>
            <p>That’s where Sunday Creek watershed coordinator Michelle Shively says it’s easy to spot the two “huge, orange elephants” in the room — two sites where contaminated water resists traditional treatment.</p>
            <p>Such treatment has been largely successful in the areas where local watershed groups and state agencies have stepped in, hopeful to reduce the the extent of the acid mine drainage.</p> 
            <p>But Truetown and Corning have found two professors willing to devise a solution for the striking orange color staining Appalachia: turning contamination into paint.</p>
            <img class="oneimg_center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Rio_tinto_river_CarolStoker_NASA_Ames_Research_Center.jpg">
            <h2 class="column20center" id="sectionone">The extent of acid mine drainage</h2>
            <p>Acid mine drainage flows out of underground abandoned coal mines and into streams, harming the areas around it. The drainage contaminates drinking water and disrupts growth of plants and animals in the streams, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
            <p>Many of the abandoned mines date back to the late 1800s and early 1900s, said Jen Bowman, an environmental project manager at OU’s Voinovich School.</p>
            <p>“Abandoned mines have caused stream pollution for many decades,” Bowman, who conducts water quality research for the school, said. “This is a long-term problem given the vast nature and extent of the underground mines.”</p>
            <p>The process involves a chemical reaction: Coal mines contain the mineral pyrite, which reacts with water and air to form sulfuric acid and iron. The sulfuric acid makes the water highly acidic, and the iron gives the water its orange color.</p>
            <p>Over time, the water drains into nearby streams, creating acid mine drainage.</p>
            <p>Shively said the acidic water coming out of mines is around 3 to 4 pH. To compare, orange juice has a pH of about 4 and normal water has a pH of 7.</p>
            <p>By 2001, about 341 miles of stream in Ohio were impacted by the contamination, according to data from the Voinovich School, which evaluates water quality.</p>
            <p>The school tested contaminated streams in 2010, and found that only 47 out of 175 miles tested qualified as a healthy habitat for animals and plants.</p>
            <p>To combat acid mine drainage, Ohio residents started watershed groups in the late 90s and partnered with state agencies, Shively said. The groups are part of Rural Action, a nonprofit community development organization based in Athens County.</p>
        <img class="oneimg_right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Rio_tinto_river_CarolStoker_NASA_Ames_Research_Center.jpg">
            <p>“All were formed by citizens who wanted something done about their creeks,” Shively said. “They’ve had their water run orange for years.”</p>
            <p>The groups worked with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to implement stream restoration projects around Southeastern Ohio.</p>
            <p>“In most cases, local watershed partners assist with project development, (water quality) sampling, landowner contacts as well as monitoring after construction,” ODNR spokesman Eric Heis said.</p>
            <p>The restoration projects usually involve running stream water through lime material, which separates the metals in the water and reduces its acidity, Shively said.</p>
            <p>For example, one method involves constructing a “leach bed,” where water runs across a bed of limestone gravel, she said. The toxic metals are separated and trapped in the bed, and the clean water returns to the stream.</p>
            <p>More than $30 million has been spent by local, state and federal governments, local partners and the university to construct 66 stream reclamation projects, Bowman said.</p>
            <p>Thankfully, the treatment is proving successful. Last year, 172 out of 183 miles tested by the Voinovich School had acceptable water quality, or at least 6.5 pH.</p>
            <h2 class="column20center">Still a problem</h2>
            <p>However, for some sites, traditional treatment methods aren’t enough. Mines are still pumping out contaminated water, and many streams in Appalachia still run orange.</p>
            <p>Some mine discharge sites, such as the ones at Truetown at Corning, release 800 to 1,000 gallons of contaminated water per minute, Shively said. The sites have a very low pH and high concentration of iron.</p>
            <p>“They’re places where … traditional systems just won’t cut it,” she said. “For a limestone leach bed, you’d have to have them on such a massive scale. It’s not feasible.”</p>
            <p>[RESIDENT QUOTES IF I GET THEM]</p>
            <p>Bowman said the mine discharge at Truetown impacts seven miles of Sunday Creek, which flows into the Hocking River.</p>
            <p>“This is a particularly difficult discharge to treat due to the volume of water and the high metal load,” she said.</p>
            <h2 class="column20center" id="sectiontwo">Art from contamination</h2>
            <p>OU professors Guy Riefler and John Sabraw may have a solution to those large discharges of acid mine drainage, however.</p>
            <p>The two perfected a process of turning the iron oxide found in the water into paint pigment. If everything goes as planned, the paint will be sold commercially and pay for water treatment.</p>
            <p>Shively, who worked on the project with them, said the idea originally grew out of hoping to restore the discharge sites. Riefler, a civil engineering professor, came up with the idea to turn the iron into paint, which Shively called “a radical way of reframing it.”</p>
            <p>To develop the paint pigment, Riefler consulted Sabraw, a professor of art and chair of Ohio University’s painting and drawing program. Sabraw said he’s always been an environmental activist interested incorporating science into his art.</p>
            <p>Over the past few years, Sabraw worked to refine the process of making the paint pigment. He used the pigment in a series of paintings called “Chroma,” which features abstract layers of paint on aluminum plates.</p>
            <p>To create the paint pigment, the iron oxide is separated from the water and dried out, Sabraw said, producing different shades of orange, yellow and black.</p>
            <blockquote class="pq_left">“Then I step in and grind it further to get a really fine grind on it,” he said. “You can make any paint at that point … acrylic or oil paint or watercolor.”</blockquote>
            <p>Shively said Sabraw’s art has received more attention than the watershed groups’ scientific work.</p>
            <p>“It’s really cool how art reaches people so effectively and significantly,” she said. “The art speaks to people in a different way than we can through science.”</p>
            <h2 class="column20center" id="sectionthree">Plans for the future</h2>
            <p>Now, the team hopes to implement the process by starting a “pilot scale” plant in Corning, which would treat the contaminated water and produce iron oxide for the paint.</p>
            <p>Sabraw said the plant would have significant environmental benefits, but the only obstacle right now is funding. Their team is in the process of applying for grants from the university and other sources.</p>
            <p>To design the plant, Sabraw consulted undergraduate students in his “Science and Art” studio art class, who helped create the proposed design.</p>
            <p>Samantha Slone, an OU alumna who graduated last spring with a bachelor’s degree in studio art, worked with Sabraw on the project and in his class.</p>
            <p>“Designing the treatment plant was a blast, because we all had to work with both aesthetic and functionality in mind, as well as how this building would fit into the community,” Slone said.</p>
            <p>Slone said she and the other students in the class tried to make the inner-workings of the treatment process more visible through their design.</p>
            <p>“If we could build this plant, it would give precise information to state of Ohio or private companies who can use the process to clean up many kinds of waste in the same manner,” he said.</p>
            <p>Sabraw said their main goal is to eventually have paint sales fund the cleanup process.</p>
            <p>“I truly hope the budget for this process comes through,” Slone said. “It would be incredible to see our work come to fruition, but more importantly, the community needs this. All life in that stream is decimated.”</p>
