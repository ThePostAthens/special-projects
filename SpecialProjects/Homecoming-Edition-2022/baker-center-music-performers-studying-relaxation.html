    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
    <p class="intro">
        <span>S</span>ounds swirl from the projections of instruments and into the ears of busy students, gently reminding them to unclench their jaws and lower their shoulders. Some students, sitting around the five floors of Baker Center, stare at their laptops and notebooks and allow the music to invade the parts of their brains. The experience creates a sense of relaxation. 

    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Andrew Holzaepfel, the senior associate director for student activities and overseer for performing arts and OHIO Live on campus, said the live music series on the second floor of Baker on Wednesdays from noon to 1:00 p.m. is meant to liven up the building. 
</p>
        <p>"This is a particularly fun series for me because I think there's so many ways to enjoy it," Holzaepfel said. "You could go down there with your lunch, you can sit there and watch it actively. You can be a (passerby) and have the opportunity to hear it." 
</p>
        <p>Bruce Dalzell curates the weekly music, Holzaepfel said, who also runs a singer-songwriter clinic for students and community members and the Open-Mic Night in Frontroom. The music heard in Baker on Wednesdays isn't limited to one genre. Holzaepfel said a lot of the music has cultural significance in the region. 
</p>
        <p>"There's a lot of stuff rooted in Appalachia that he brings in," Holzaepfel said. "There's a lot of stuff that's really connected to this region musically, so I think that's important to be able to showcase that type of music."
</p>
        <p>Holzaepfel said the music heard throughout the building can provide people with the opportunity to be present in the moment. Whether students are running through Baker as a shortcut to their next class or using one of the floors to study, the music, and music in general, means something different to each of them. 
</p>
        <p>According to an article published by <a href="https://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/centers-and-initiatives/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/about-hmni/archive-brain-1" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a>, music stimulates the brain and can alter brain function and structure. These changes can be healing, particularly for neurological conditions, but for general well-being.
</p>
        <p>Olivia Ashbaugh, a sophomore studying middle childhood education, said music helps her when taking notes for classes but not if she needs to maintain focus on other school work. Ashbaugh has heard Baker's live music while passing through the building but hasn't stopped by to listen in attentively. However, Ashbaugh said the music, depending on what genre is playing on a specific Wednesday, could be relaxing. 
</p>
		<p>"I feel like I could if it's peaceful," Ashbaugh said. "I especially like music that has no words." 
</p>
		<p>Similarly, Samantha Serfozo, a junior studying exercise physiology, frequently takes advantage of Baker's escalators, which subjects her to the live performers. However, when not just passing by, Serfozo, such as other students, takes comfort in the building's copious study corners. 
</p>
		<p>Everyone has their own study ritual that may or may not include music. While Serfozo said that there are instances when music can deter concentration, musicians can also evoke positive emotions within an environment.
</p>
		<p>"It depends what kind of music it is," Serfozo said. "If it's smooth jazz, I'm fine with it. But if it's like actual loud singing I don't really want it in a study room."
</p>
		<p></p>
				<p>Music has the power to influence one's state of mind, and Serfozo said that she has experienced instances in which music has helped improve her mood and even her days.
</p>

				<p>"I feel like if it's the right environment, and people want to go and want to watch it, it's really nice," Serfozo said. 
</p>

				<p>OU's showcase of artistic talent, such as music performers, can be seen as one of the most integral aspects of its efforts to ensure that students are diversified in a world both of academics and art. Not only are these performances engaging for people such as Holzaepfel and others at the university, the live music sometimes just offers a break. 
</p>
<p>"Music plays an important part of my life," Holzaepfel said. "No matter what kind of genre, … there's a healing power to it. So the opportunity just to take a moment, even if you stop on the railing and watch and observe a song or two, it's just a pause of the day and the ability to take a moment of wellness."
