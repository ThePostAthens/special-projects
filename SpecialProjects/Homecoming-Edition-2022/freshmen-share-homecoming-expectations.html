    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
    <p class="intro">
        <span>O</span>hio University's Homecoming Week is Oct. 3-8, and, this year, over 4,000 freshmen will participate in the festivities for the first time.
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Although Homecoming week kicked off Monday, two of the most popular attractions, the OU Homecoming parade and football game, will occur on Saturday. The parade begins at 10 a.m. and will start on West Union Street and proceed to College Green.</p>
        <p>Tyson Bernath, a freshman studying journalism, said he is looking forward to this year's Homecoming parade.</p>
        <p>"I'm excited for the parade and getting to see the football team play at home," Bernath said. "I think that's a big part of Homecoming. I'm really excited to see who all comes back to Athens."        </p>
        <p>Following the parade, the OU football team will play the University of Akron at 2 p.m. at Peden Stadium. Melanie Geiger, a freshman studying marketing, said she will be attending the game.</p>
        <blockquote class="pq_center">“There's going to be more spirit because there's going to be so many people that are curious, like me, to see what it's about. I already talked to a lot of freshmen that are interested to see what it's like and I just feel like there's going to be more support for the football team because it's such a big weekend.”<span class="attribution">-Melanie Geiger</span></blockquote>
        <p>Although many freshmen are new to Athens, some grew up surrounded by OU's Homecoming festivities. Abby Motes, a freshman studying nursing, grew up in Athens and had family members attend the university.        </p>
        <p>"My sister went to college here so the whole family would come out and everybody would just do stuff and (go to the) football game or like any and every event you could think of," Motes said.</p>
    <p>Motes said COVID-19 changed a lot of the Homecoming celebrations she experienced when she was younger.    </p>
    <p>"With COVID-19 and everything like the last few years, I feel like everything's been kind of crazy and they haven't really gotten to do as much as they typically do that I saw growing up in Athens," Motes said. "I don't really know what to expect besides like a lot of people coming back to come home for the weekend and visit and everything."    </p>
    <p>Students who are new to Athens are unsure of what to expect for this upcoming weekend.    </p>
    <p>"I'll definitely go see the parade and the football team," Bernath said. "I'm excited to see what else there is I haven't heard a whole lot but whatever comes up, I'm sure I'll be out at it."</p>
    <p>Motes said she is looking forward to spending a weekend in Athens during Homecoming, surrounded by fellow students.</p>
    <p>"(I'm looking forward to) kind of everything being here for the weekend and not like home," Motes said. "Actually being here and being around people. And I feel like Homecoming is like one of the biggest things."    </p>
    <p>Despite not knowing what to expect, Bernath said he believes Homecoming is a significant way for the university to come together.    </p>
    <blockquote class="pq_right">“I think it's just a way to have a community celebrate itself, even if you are no longer in that community. Being able to come back and celebrate, 'Hey, we made it through everything here and we might not be here in this community, but we're representing our community.'”<span class="attribution">-Tyson Bernath</span></blockquote> 
    <p> Many freshman students are enthusiastic for this year's Homecoming festivities, given that the previous years have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. </p>
    <p>"I think it just brings everyone together to remind us that we are a Bobcat family and that we're more than just a schoolwork community," Geiger said.    </p>
