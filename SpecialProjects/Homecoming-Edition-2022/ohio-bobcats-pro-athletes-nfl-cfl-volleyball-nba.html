    <p class="intro">
        <span>W</span>hether it’s football, volleyball, baseball or basketball, Ohio has a former athlete who’s playing the sport professionally. 
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Here’s a list of former Ohio athlete’s currently playing pro:</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Armani Rogers</h2></div>
        <p>Armani Rogers played quarterback at UNLV for three seasons before transferring to Ohio for his redshirt fifth year. Rogers frequently switched on and off with current Ohio quarterback Kurtis Rourke last season and would often play when Ohio needed a leg-up in its run game. Rogers was Ohio’s second leading rusher in 2021 with 552 yards on 92 attempts.</p>
        <p>Now in the NFL, Rogers plays tight end for the Washington Commanders. He had one reception on one target for 23 yards in their first game this season.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Tarell Basham</h2></div>
        <p>Defensive end Tarell Basham was drafted 80th overall in the 2017 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts. He played there for two seasons before signing with the New York Jets. He currently plays for the Dallas Cowboy. On Sept. 17, Basham was placed on the injured reserve due to a thigh injury. </p>
        <p>At Ohio, Basham was a defensive star. One of his most notable games was in 2016 at Tennessee. He had five total tackles, two sacks and forced a fumble in Ohio’s 28-19 loss.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Casey Sayles</h2></div>
        <p>Sayles is a defensive lineman who played at Ohio from 2013-16, where he had 111 total tackles, 12.5 sacks and three fumble recoveries in 50 games.</p>
        <p>Since his time at Ohio, Sayles has bounced back and forth between professional football leagues. He now plays in the Canadian Football League for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Sayles has played in 15 games so far this season, totaling 28 tackles and three sacks.</p>
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ohi/ea8be2cc-af30-4e4a-b60e-8db2ee09021c.sized-1000x1000.png?" alt="Describe image here" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">photographer| Jesse Jarrold-grapes</p><p class="pcut">image description here</p> </div>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Papi White</h2></div>
        <p>Papi White is a wide receiver for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the CFL. He has 42 receptions for 414 yards and a touchdown across two seasons.</p>
        <p>In 2017, White only played in nine games but still led the Bobcats in receiving yards with 631. During that season, White was named to the Second Team All-MAC Offense.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">AJ Ouellette</h2></div>
        <p>AJ Ouellette is second on the Toronto Argonauts in rushing with 289 yards. He is also one of only three players on the Argonauts to score a rushing touchdown this season. In addition to being a force on the ground, Oullette is one of his quarterback’s favorite targets in the air. He has 290 yards on 29 receptions so far in 2022.</p>
        <p>In 2018, Oullette was the Bobcats leading rusher with 1306 yards. That season, he averaged 100.46 yards per game and was one of two running backs named to the 2018 All-MAC First Team Offense. Oullette is one of only four Bobcats with back-to-back 1000 rushing yard seasons.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Nathan Rourke</h2></div>
        <p>Nathan Rourke is turning heads in his second season with the BC Lions of the CFL. On Aug. 6, Rourke completed 34-37 pass attempts for 477 yards and five touchdowns in the Lions seventh game.</p>
        <p>Rourke had a combined 3281 yards and 25 touchdowns in the first nine games of the season before injuring his right foot and needing surgery. Rourke fans should have no fear, as he is expected to return towards the end of the CFL regular season.</p>
        <p>Rourke is no stranger to putting up big numbers and breaking records. He has the second most passing yards and touchdowns in program history and is one of the greatest quarterbacks Ohio has ever seen.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Tia Jimerson</h2></div>
        <p>Tia Jimerson played volleyball at Ohio from 2017-20. As a middle blocker, she won many awards throughout her college years including American Volleyball Coaches Association Honorable Mention All-America, AVCA All-Region, MAC Player of the Year and MAC Co-Defensive Player of the Year in 2019.</p>
        <p>In July 2021, Jimerson signed her first professional contract with Szent Benedek Roplabda in Balatonfured, Hungary. Although she doesn’t play in Hungary anymore, she still plays professionally in Portugal with AJM/FC Porto.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Maggie Nedoma</h2></div>
        <p>Maggie Nedoma is another former Ohio Volleyball player who now plays professionally overseas. In 2021, she was one of Ohio’s most trusted hitters and finished second on the team in kills.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 3, Nedoma signed with Clamart Volley-Ball in Clamart, France. Now, Nedoma plays in Switzerland.</p>
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ohi/e3dae754-fc86-4396-b1e0-211fbbd31ffe.sized-1000x1000.png?" alt="Describe image here" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">photographer| Jesse Jarrold-grapes</p><p class="pcut">image description here</p> </div>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Joe Rock</h2></div>
        <p>In just his second start of the 2021 season at Ohio, left-hand pitcher Joe Rock threw a no-hitter and put himself on the radar of baseball fans everywhere. Rock would go on to finish the 2021 season leading the team in ERA, wins, complete games, innings pitched, and strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Rock was drafted by the Colorado Rockies as the 68th overall pick in Competitive Balance Round B of the MLB Draft. Last season, Rock started in 22 games in the minor leagues, going 7-8. Rock is currently the Rockies 16th best prospect.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Logan Cozart</h2></div>
        <p>Logan Cozart pitched at Ohio from 2011-15. He started his professional baseball career in the Pioneer League, a Major League Baseball partner league, before being assigned to the Colorado Rockies. Cozart has played for multiple different MiLB teams at multiple levels, and even spent some time playing for the Tomateros de Culiacan in the Mexican Pacific League. 
            This past season, Cozart spent most of his time with the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Triple-A affiliate of the Rockies. Throughout his minor league career, Cozart is 22-18.
            </p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Jason Preston</h2></div>
        <p>If you were a fan of Ohio Men’s Basketball from 2018-21, you remember Jason Preston. The point guard helped lead the team to its infamous March Madness run in 2021. Preston was named Second Team All-MAC in 2020 and First Team All-MAC in 2021. In 2020, he led the MAC in assists, assists per game, and minutes per game.</p>
        <p>Preston was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the 33rd pick in the 2021 NBA draft, but his draft rights were traded to the Los Angeles Clippers shortly thereafter. Preston played in a handful of games before obtaining a season-ending foot injury, but he expected to play in the 2022 season.</p>
