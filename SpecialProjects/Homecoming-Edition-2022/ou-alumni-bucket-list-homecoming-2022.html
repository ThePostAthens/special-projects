    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
<p class="intro">
        <span>F</span>or OU alum, Homecoming is exactly what it sounds like: coming home. OU's Homecoming is undoubtedly a celebrated time for current Bobcats, but it is particularly intended to be special for the alum that came before them.
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>This coming weekend, many Bobcat alum will return back to the bricks that built them. Though most will only be here for a short time, there are many aspects they will be adamant on reliving. So, Bobcat alum, what is it that you're all most looking forward to doing? Is it having a "junction punch" at The J-Bar? Or feasting on a "bagelwich" from Bagel Street Deli? Or maybe you'll simply revisit the old organizations you were a part of as an undergrad? Whatever it may be, here is a list of "must-do's" for your reunion with Athens:</p>
        <p><strong>Visit all of your old places of living</strong></p>
        <p>A large part of what shapes a college career is where you live during your time in Athens. Whether it be one of the run-down dorms that undeniably possess a whole lot of character on Dirty South, or a dilapidated house on Congress Street, the places and people you live with play an integral role in shaping your experiences.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, taking a stroll past your dorm, fraternity/sorority house, old apartment or house may evoke memories you might've forgotten or the ones you always find an excuse to bring up in conversation. Plus, with how generous and welcoming Bobcats are, odds are if you knock on a door and strike up a conversation, you could even take a tour through your own old personal stomping grounds.</p>
        <p><strong>Take a walk through College Green</strong></p>
        <p>Nothing compares to fall in Athens, making Homecoming's timing quite perfect. When most imagine their past days at OU, they immediately picture College Green during the fall. Take a morning or afternoon stroll through College Green with a Donkey coffee and enjoy the sights of the freshly fallen leaves. For those who have moved to a big city, this will be a beneficial and peaceful reset that could turn an average day into a great one.</p>
        <p><strong>Take a Hot Nut shot from Tony's</strong></p>
        <p>If there's one shot from the various bars on Court Street that is highly talked about, it's a Hot Nut shot from Tony's. Those who aren't former or current Bobcats simply will never understand the obsession of what may seem like a simple shot. Its steaminess consists of part coffee and part Dekuyper's hazelnut bliss. And truly, it is bliss. Be careful; it may seem painless to knock down four or five, given their sweet taste, but they will undoubtedly sneak up on you!</p>
        <p><strong>Have Bagel Street Deli for breakfast</strong></p>
        <p>Every Bobcat's favorite breakfast destination is Bagel Street Deli. You can guarantee a long line through the door and out into Court Street almost every weekend. With an endless list of options, there is a bagel or sandwich to satisfy all taste buds. Alum, recount what bagel it is that helped you through the hardest hangovers and earliest morning classes and get to ordering it. But don't wait too late into the day, as the wait for a bagel is sure to get longer and longer.</p>
        <p><strong>Go out to dinner at Jackie O's</strong></p>
        <p>If there is any question I always get asked by alum, it's if us students love grabbing dinner at Jackie O's. Many broke college students don't venture there unless their parents pay them a visit, but the restaurant/bar has delicious burgers, flatbreads, wings, craft beer, pickle shots and more. Make those reservations ASAP, as it will likely be booked up for the big weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>Attend the parade and football game</strong></p>
        <p>Show your school spirit, Bobcat pride and alma mater appreciation by attending both the annual Homecoming parade and football game. Both of these events are a hit among both alum and current undergrad students, making it a special event where people can make connections, meet new faces, catch up with old ones and relive the true, American college experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Revisit your old organizations</strong></p>
        <p>Most likely, you alum were once a member of some organization you were, and probably still are, passionate about. These organizations are likely what formed your college experience. They're the places and clubs you may have met your best friends in, or attained your current work experience from. Take a walk down memory lane by touring your old sorority or fraternity house, old college newspaper or TV station, former consumer research or sales program, dance club, frisbee golf team, or simply, your old classrooms. You will, without a doubt, meet current Bobcats similar to you, and potentially ones that could soon be your colleague.</p>
        <p><strong>Try a new place</strong></p>
        <p>Athens has changed greatly since several Bobcats were on the bricks. Courtside Pizza is still new to many, The Junction is now known as J-Bar and many new food places have popped up throughout the years. So, although reliving what you remember is always key to a nostalgic weekend, visiting a new destination that is special to many current Bobcats is a great way to form new bonds with a place that so many people across the nation will forever call "hOUme."</p>
