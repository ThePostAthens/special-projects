         <p>Homecoming at Ohio University is a weekend full of fun, friends and no sleep. Showing your Bobcat pride means being on Court Street at the crack of dawn to make memories with your besties. While it is a weekend that most OU students look forward to, it can be a long two days that you need to prepare for. Here are some tips and tricks to get you through the exciting, yet tiring weekend:

Some students, sitting around the five floors of Baker Center, stare at their laptops and notebooks and allow the music to invade the parts of their brains. The experience creates a sense of relaxation.

          <p>Stai pledged to make 2022 “the complete opposite” of 2021, and rightfully so. He was at the pinnacle of his collegiate career last year, but that was before everything came crumbling down.</p>

            <p>“If you’d told me two years ago that I’d be in the hospital twice in a matter of six months for two things that were out of my control, I wouldn’t believe you,” Stai said.</p>

     <p>Ohio University's Homecoming Week is Oct. 3-8, and, this year, over 4,000 freshmen will participate in the festivities for the first time.</p>

      <p>Although Homecoming week kicked off Monday, two of the most popular attractions, the OU Homecoming parade and football game, will occur on Saturday. The parade begins at 10 a.m. and will start on West Union Street and proceed to College Green.</p>

      <p>Tyson Bernath, a freshman studying journalism, said he is looking forward to this year's Homecoming parade.</p>
         <img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ohi/81780330-bc1b-4f55-991d-3ece6f9c6351.sized-1000x1000.jpg? "

       <p> "I'm excited for the parade and getting to see the football team play at home," Bernath said. "I think that's a big part of Homecoming. I'm really excited to see who all comes back to Athens."</p>

        <p>Following the parade, the OU football team will play the University of Akron at 2 p.m. at Peden Stadium. Melanie Geiger, a freshman studying marketing, said she will be attending the game.</p>

      </div><p>Homecoming is a very exciting time. Current and former Bobcats get to reunite with old friends, visit nostalgic places and come back to a city that holds a special place in their lives. Many events take place in celebration of Homecoming, but all of them center around one thing: the football game.</p>

      <p>This year, Ohio’s Homecoming game will take place against Akron, who is 1-4 this season. Akron has been at the bottom of the Mid-American Conference for the past couple of years, and the game should be winnable for Ohio. Regardless of the game’s outcome, it will still be exciting. The Homecoming game is about school spirit, camaraderie and coming together to cheer on your alma mater or current team.</p>

      <p>We’ve always said that one of the best things about sports is the way they can bring people together. Some of our own earliest and best memories involve sitting down and watching sports with our families or actually going to a game. There is nothing quite like the feeling of being in a stadium, arena or field to watch one of your favorite teams, which is something that current and former Bobcats can look forward to this weekend...</p>

      <P>Much of Ohio University's annual homecoming events revolve around connecting with those who walked the bricks before us current students. Amidst all of the university's efforts to plan memorable events, many forget the underlying base for the celebratory weekend: OU and its history.</P>

      <p>One thing all Bobcats share is their love for Ohio; the university has provided us with an influx of knowledge, experiences and memories to last a lifetime.</p>

     <p>For those who want to gain better insight on what makes OU, here is a list of some of our school's biggest historical milestones, along with a few fun facts that will make most people appreciate the campus even more.</p>

      <p>Oldest college in the state</p>

      <p>Though this fact is widely-known, some may be unaware they are currently attending or once attended the first public college institution in the state. OU was founded in 1804 and opened in 1808 with only one building, three students and one professor. 20 years later, in 1828, John Newton Templeton became the first Black graduate of OU with an A.B. degree. He was also the third Black man to graduate from college in the U.S. The Templeton-Blackburn Alumni Memorial Auditorium, more commonly known as MemAud, was named after this historical figure.</p>

    <p>However, his most important work at Ohio has been done off the field. On Sept. 9, Caesar received the Mid-American Conference Diversity & Inclusion Student-Athlete Award. Caesar is the second Ohio athlete in a row to win this award, after wrestler Kamal Adewumi won it in 2021.</p>

    <p>Caesar was surprised by the news, as Ohio coach Tim Albin allowed him to have a special moment with his teammates.</p>

      <p>Having received this recognition, she is excited to share Athens with her great nieces this weekend. Part of her tour will include showing them where she got started on her career path and memories of attending OU.</p>

        <p>“My time at OU obviously was a very special time,” Ackerman said. “Of course to be away from home and be sort of on your own for the first time is its own exhilarating experience. But certainly, in the time that I was at OU, because there were maybe 200 African American students. We were sort of our own community.”

         <p>The word "Homecoming" will resonate differently with everyone embellished in green and white this weekend. For some, the event serves as an excuse to become a football fan, avoid a dreaded paper or possibly take on Court Street. </p>
     <p>However, for others, the word aligns with its literal meaning: an opportunity to return to one's roots. Since 1919, Ohio University alums have been welcomed and celebrated by faculty and students, proving that there really is no place like home. </p>
</p>
        <p>In attempts to better understand how the perception of Homecoming differs for those routinely and recently affiliated with OU, it is imperative to consider the connections Homecoming allows people to rekindle. </p>

        <p >It is Sunday morning, and you roll out of bed around noon to get a coffee and assess the weekend's events with your friends. It's a beautiful day; the sun is out, offset by a soft breeze. Countless other students wander Court Street, running errands, catching up with friends and grabbing food. The leaves have begun to turn, and the brick roads are speckled with yellow and orange. </p>
         <p>You begin to notice a lot of other things in the street, too: aluminum beer cans, solo cups, discarded plastic vape packages, empty Fireball shooters, cigarette butts, smashed glass bottles and plastic bags.
</p>
        <p>If you have stepped foot on Court Street on the weekends, then you are familiar with the amount of improperly discarded waste that accumulates on the sidewalk, in the gutters and along the road seemingly overnight. What's even crazier than how quickly trash accumulates is that Court Street is quite literally lined with trash and recycling bins- you are never more than a couple yards away from one.

        <p>When students choose a college and move on from the first 18 years of their lives, they have one major thing in common: saying goodbye to lifelong friends and thrusting themselves into a new, independent journey. Managing these relationships while making new friends and creating a social life can be hard. On top of that, there’s so much schoolwork to do, unless you’re a business major.</p>
        <p>For me, it was particularly tough because I had had the same friends since kindergarten. How was I supposed to maintain these relationships while not overlooking life at Ohio University? I was worried that we’d gradually fade out of touch. Well, I now have the best answer for the conundrum: fantasy football.</p> 

            <p>Fantasy football transcends time and distance- it’s just something I have to do. My friends and I have an eight-team league that keeps us within our roots. In high school, we would talk trash about sports and get competitive over trivial differences. I loved it, and I hope my friends did too (sometimes I’m not sure because I tend to be unnecessarily ruthless in a sardonic way to the ones I love). The relationship we built lives on every NFL season. We get our competitive kick, and it’s just like the good old days when times were simpler...</p>

      </div>
     <p> Not to be cheesy, but music brings people together. You can joke all day long about romanticizing your life, being the main character, but the right music marks the most significant chapters of our lives, acting as bookmarks for the core memories we revisit.</p>
    </p>
     <p>Looking back on Homecoming last year, I vividly remember two songs: “Silk Chiffon” by MUNA featuring Phoebe Bridgers and “All Too Well” by Taylor Swift. My friends and I were having so much fun, and the image of us borderline screaming the lyrics is always the first thing that comes to mind while reminiscing on Homecoming.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, I avoid songs because hearing them makes me physically ill. Certain memories are actually haunting. Literally, as I wrote this column, “Clueless” by The Marías, a song I had completely forgotten about, started playing through my headphones and my entire body froze (don’t get me started on “Stop This Train” by John Mayer and “The Night We Met” by Lord Huron). But I’m not going to sit here and trauma dump. I would rather talk more about how music can be so strongly connected with some of our favorite memories. Homecoming at Ohio University is no exception.</p>

        <p>For OU alum, Homecoming is exactly what it sounds like: coming home. OU's Homecoming is undoubtedly a celebrated time for current Bobcats, but it is particularly intended to be special for the alum that came before them.</p>
         <p>This coming weekend, many Bobcat alum will return back to the bricks that built them. Though most will only be here for a short time, there are many aspects they will be adamant on reliving. So, Bobcat alum, what is it that you're all most looking forward to doing? Is it having a "junction punch" at The J-Bar? Or feasting on a "bagelwich" from Bagel Street Deli? Or maybe you'll simply revisit the old organizations you were a part of as an undergrad? Whatever it may be, here is a list of "must-do's" for your reunion with Athens:</p>
