        <p>Admit it, we’ve all had times when we’ve wanted to watch a movie on Netflix but can’t decide which one. Next time you’re looking for a great movie to satisfy your movie night, check out one of these LGBT-centered flicks:</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>Blue Is the Warmest Color</i> (2013)</h2></div>
        
        <p><i>Blue Is the Warmest Color</i> is a drama centered on a 15-year-old girl named Adele (Adèle Exarchopoulos) who meets this woman with short blue hair named Emma (Léa Seydoux) that makes her question her sexuality and everything she knows. Adele breaks up with her boyfriend and is sent into emotional turmoil when her friends at school ostracise her. However, she keeps spending time with Emma and their relationship grows. This movie is a beautiful example of a woman coming to terms with her sexuality and understanding who she is and what she wants, even if some people get hurt along the way. This French coming-of-age film is erotic, romantic and definitely one you can’t miss.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>Alex Strangelove</i> (2018)</h2></div>
        
        <p><i>Alex Strangelove</i> is a comedy-drama that lets us in on the life of a kid named Alex Truelove (Daniel Doheny) and his girlfriend Claire (Madeline Weinstein) and they really want to have sex. They have been planning it for a while, and they finally book a hotel room to seal the deal. However when Alex meets a boy named Elliot (Antonio Marziale), he begins to have strong feelings for him that are severely confusing. This film will have you laughing, cringing and smiling ear to ear as you watch this teen navigate his sexual identity.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>G.B.F.</i> (2013)</h2></div>

Brent decides he’s going to out himself at prom because the three most popular girls in school are all searching for a G.B.F. in hopes of securing prom queen. However, with the help of the gay-straight alliance club, Tanner is accidentally outed to the whole school and the attention is geared to him from the popular girls instead of Brent. This sparks a competition between the two best friends as Tanner gains the popularity instead of Brent. This classic high school popularity plot showcases the importance of understanding other people’s sexualities and being proud of who you are no matter what.</p>

Ray wants to start the testosterone shots and begin the actual process of changing his gender but to do so requires the approval of both parents. The movie revolves around Maggie searching for Ray’s father, who has been absent Ray’s whole life. With some unexpected twists, this movie is a great example of the difficulties with going through a transitional period as a transgender person.</p>

After a year of serving on the board, one of the other members Dan White (Josh Brolin) kills Milk in cold blood. This biographical-drama and documentary-style film doubles with actual footage and reenactment footage.</p>
