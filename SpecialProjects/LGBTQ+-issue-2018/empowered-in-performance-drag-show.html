        <p>To Chris Nevil, being a drag queen has been an experience of a lifetime.</p>
        
        <p>“Drag is like an escape for me,” Nevil, a financial analyst, said. “You get to be someone else and just let loose. You get out there and put your all into it.”</p>
        
        <p>Drag is a way for people to dress up as an exaggerated gender and entertain audiences with elaborate costumes, singing and dancing. For many drag performers, the experience is an empowering form of expressing oneself.</p>
        
        <p>Nevil has helped out with many drag shows Athens Uncorked presents once a month for quite some time, but just recently got into drag performance last year.</p>
        
        <p>“Last Halloween was my first show I ever did, and it was awesome,” Nevil said. “To take on this bold other persona was such a rush.”</p>
        
        <p>Nevil performs under the stage name Kazma Knights, a crazy performer who isn’t afraid to dance when she’s on stage.</p>
        
        <p>“Kazma is a bit of a comic,” Nevil said. “She loves to dance, but she’s definitely not one to do a death drop.”</p>
        
        <p>In the past year, Nevil has realized how much hard work and planning goes into making a drag queen. From the constant outfit changes to practicing performances in his home, the life of drag performance is a big-time investment.</p>
        
        <p>“When I hear that people do it as their primary job, I can’t help but imagine they have to be working all the time,” Nevil said. “I practice in my living room a lot, just blaring my music. My neighbors probably think I’m crazy, but you gotta do what you gotta do to look good on stage.”</p>
        
        <p>Nevil not only does drag for the fun of it, but for the benefit of others. He hosted his own drag show in memory of his aunt and raised money for the Athens County Board of Developmental Disabilities, which helps integrate individuals with developmental disabilities into the area as valued citizens.</p>
        
        <p>“Drag is a really cool way to raise money for things that may not be easy to raise money for,” Nevil said. “It’s a fun thing to do as well as a great way to help others.”</p>
        
        <p>Since Nevil’s start in drag performing, his friends and family have been very supportive. His friends especially come out and watch him perform whenever they get the chance. Nevil’s parents experienced their son’s first drag performance at the benefit he put on for his mother’s sister. Despite being out of their comfort zones, they loved it.</p>
        
        <p>“My parents had the time of their lives,” Nevil said. “My dad told me I was ‘one heck of a performer,’ so it was very cool. My parents have always been supportive but I never dreamed they’d come to a drag show.”</p>
        
        <p>Although Nevil grew up in Athens and acknowledges that it’s a fairly cultured city, there were certain aspects of the LGBTQ popuation that he didn’t know much about until being a part of drag.</p>
        
        <p>“Drag has definitely educated me more regarding different genders,” Nevil said. “There’s a lot of stigma around drag queens that they want to become a woman, or that trans-women can’t be drag, but that’s just not the case.”</p>
        
        <p>Loren Marsan, an assistant lecturer of women’s, gender and sexuality studies professor, chose drag as her PhD dissertation topic and, through research, discovered that drag has been stigmatized since the ‘70s and ‘80s.</p>
        
        <p>“Even within the LGBTQ community, drag queens were making them look bad, especially amongst gay men,” Marsan said. “Those who did drag were seen outside the norm, making all the normal gay men look bad.”</p>
        
        <p>In spite of the stigmatized past many people who were drag performers faced, steps have been taken in the right direction by evacuating drag of its political meaning.</p>
        
        <p>“Drag has an exceedingly long political history of challenging the construction of gender and its presentation,” Marsan said. “We used to pigeon-hole people into particular identities and then question those identities, but we no longer do that.”</p>
        
        <p>In the past, drag was seen as a hyperbolic presentation to call out the constructiveness of what it was, but today, it’s a performance like no other, Marsan said.</p>
        
        <p>“Drag is an outlet to present something different, or to make fun of what you present on a regular day,” Marsan said. “Drag is what you make it, and it can be empowering to take on a different persona.”</p>
        
        <p>For Bolo J, a consultant to non-profit organizations, being a drag queen has been an empowering experience that allows for an expression of freedom.</p>
        
        <p>“I personally do it because it represents freedom from oppressive stereotypes that society places on queer people of color,” Bolo J said. “When I perform, I get to share those clear moments of freedom with the audience.”</p>
        
        <p>Bolo J’s alternate persona is Miss Isis A. Cocoabutter, a “trailer park chic” drag queen.</p>
        
        <p>“She’s pretty much the day after hangover look,” Bolo J said. “Basically envision Katy Perry's song, ‘Last Friday Night’.”</p>
        
        <p>Miss Isis A. Cocoabutter has performed a couple of times in Athens for benefit drag shows. Bolo J just recently organized a show at The Union Bar and Grill on behalf of the People’s Justice League.</p>
        
        <p>“P.J.L. is a community group that does a lot for the southern Ohio region to help make places safe for every group of people, whether on campus or out in public,” Bolo J said.</p>
        
        <p>Bolo J was exposed to drag in their undergraduate years and discovered that it was a beautiful thing that they wish more would know about.</p>
        
        <p>“People need to recognize the boundaries of others,” Bolo J said. “There are differences, and not everyone fits into a box. Drag has evolved in such a way that these boxes don’t exist.”</p>
