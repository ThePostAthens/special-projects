        <p>People who identify as LGBTQ are not protected by nondiscrimination laws for housing and employment in Ohio. House Bill 160 could change that.</p>
        
        <p>House Bill 160, or the Ohio Fairness Act, <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-HB-160">seeks to change</a> Ohio’s nondiscrimination laws. These changes include protections for sexual orientation, gender identity or expression along with protections of race, color, religion, sex, age, ancestry, national origin, disability or military status.</p>
        
        <p>Similar acts have circulated Ohio’s legislature for about a decade.</p>
        
        <p>“We’ve already seen a big difference in the time between 2009 and now,” Rep. Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) said. “When the Obergefell decision came down from the Supreme Court, it gave a legal standing to gay and lesbian families and I think it also helped further the conversation about members if the LGBTQ community in general.”</p>
        
        <p>As the bill awaits further movement in committee, organizations such as Ohio Business Competes, the Humans Rights Campaign and Equality Ohio are working to advocate for the bill through personal testimonies and gathering businesses to support the bill.</p>
        
        <p>Businesses, both small and national, have signed in support of House Bill 160 through Ohio Business Competes, which is a non-partisan coalition <a href="http://ohiobusinesscompetes.org/members/">committed to nondiscrimination</a> policies at the state level.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, there is an increase in businesses joining the Human Rights Campaign business index each year. That organization has come forward in saying that nondiscrimination policy is good for business, Antonio said.</p>
        
        <p>“Some of these huge national and even international companies, when they’re looking to put down roots in a state, they have made it very clear that they are also looking at places that have these kinds of policies in place,” Antonio said. “It could make a huge difference for who looks at us in Ohio and who just decides that we’re just a drive over state.”</p>
        
        <p>The bill could mean more people staying in Ohio instead of moving to more progressive states, Antonio said.</p>
        
        <p>“The idea behind civil rights laws is that it means that the government is taking an active role in leveling the playing field for groups that have been shown to be historically disadvantaged,” Susan Burgess, a distinguished professor of political science, said.</p>
        
        <p>The bill has been endorsed by the Ohio Chamber of Commerce for the first time.</p>
        
        <p>“I know the reason (the Ohio Chamber of Commerce is) supporting it is because they know that these kinds of policies, if the state takes a stand, it is very good for Ohio’s standing in the rest of the country in terms of advancing business and advancing the economic bottom line in the state of Ohio,” Antonio said.</p>
        
        <p>Because certain areas around the state already have nondiscrimination policies or ordinances, the statewide law would extend those protections everywhere in the state.</p>
        
        <p>“Athens is a bubble in many different ways and has been a safe haven which is great. (Ohio University) has also been a safe haven for many of us and so just wanting to expand that safe haven and in some ways, burst that bubble so we’re not just limited to being in Athens,” delfin bautista, director of the LGBTQ Center, said.</p>
        
        <p>For people who are LGBTQ, the passage of the bill would mean greater equality and the ability to live without fear of losing their homes or jobs because of who they are, bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>“When laws like this are passed, they also serve as an educational moment and model, and so it affords the opportunity to talk about what fairness and equality mean,” Antonio said.</p>
        
        <p>In states where such laws have passed, there has not been upsurge in nondiscrimination cases, Antonio said. More so, they serve as a determinant for people to be discriminated against.</p>
        
        <p>“I think it’ll send a clear message that there’s a lot of groups that have been lifting up ‘all are equal needs to mean all are equal’ and so we say that we are all equal, how are we living into that and how are we not living into that and if we’re not living into it, how can we better live into it,” bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>The bill is currently in the government oversight accountability committee.</p>
