        <p>In this issue of <i>The Post</i>, we hope to celebrate LGBTQ culture and the individuals, both on our campus and in the larger Athens area, while raising awareness and educating our readers on issues that matter.</p>
        
        <p>We know that sometimes, reality is quite different than what appears on paper. And frankly, it seems that we sometimes live within a well-insulated bubble. Far too often, we think of Athens as a city that harbors diversity in its many forms, yet we know things are far from perfect.</p>
        
        <p>Discrimination, harassment and everyday microaggressions against LGBTQ students and residents are pervasive issues that stymie progress and prevent our university and our city from moving forward. We believe, however, that by telling stories and reporting honestly, we can spark conversation.</p>
        
        <p>In creating this issue, our assistant managing editor, Jessica Hill, constantly consulted with members of the Ohio University LGBT Center to ensure that when reporting on these topics, we’re reporting with sensitivity and accuracy. It’s something we’ve been striving to get better at, whether it’s through our regular “Query a Queer” column or by updating our policies to be better in line with the times.</p>
        
        <p>A few years ago, <i>The Post</i> followed the Associated Press with the decision to allow they/them pronouns as singular and, therefore, grammatically acceptable. Although this might seem like a trivial change to some readers, it can make all the difference to our gender-nonconforming sources.</p>
        
        <p>We train our reporters to be in the constant habit of confirming pronouns when talking with sources, and we reiterate that these pronouns are not preferences — they’re fact.</p>
        
        <p>Since last year, we’ve been partnering with the Office for Diversity and Inclusion to ensure all members of our staff receive SafeZone training in order to become better, more effective allies.</p>
        
        <p>However, we also acknowledge with the publication of the LGBTQ issue, there are still some identities left unexplored and underreported on.</p>
        
        <p>Admittedly, this issue could be better. I wish we would have paid more attention to telling the stories of those who are questioning or identify as intersex, pansexual, two-spirit, androgynous or asexual. While we have come a long way in our understanding and appreciation of the full spectrum of identities, there is still a considerably long way to go.</p>
        
        <p>My hope is that you will find this issue of <i>The Post</i> to be informative, sensitive and celebratory of the vibrant LGBTQ culture and individuals on our campus and in our city.</p>
