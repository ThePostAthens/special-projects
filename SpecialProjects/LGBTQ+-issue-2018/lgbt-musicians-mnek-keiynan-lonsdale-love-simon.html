        <p>Representation in film, television and music is important. Allowing children to grow up in a world surrounded with people that look like them, act like them or identify like them is a great way for children to realize they’re accepted. In the mainstream music industry, there have been many artists and bands that have used their platforms and their personal lives to promote a message of inclusion and acceptance. Classic artists such as Elton John or the great-late Freddie Mercury to more modern artists; such as, England’s Sam Smith or YouTube-sensation Troye Sivan, LGBT recognition is prevalent in the music industry. Here are seven lesser known LGBT artists that are making great hits:</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Keiynan Lonsdale</h2></div>
        
        <p><i>Love, Simon</i> was the first gay, coming-of-age romantic-comedy to debut with a studio release. It brought teenage same-sex relationships to the big screen and also introduced Keiynan Lonsdale to the world. Lonsdale has been open about how at the time of filming, he was still grappling with his own sexulaity and the film helped him come out as queer. Lonsdale is a triple threat. He can obviously act, he’s a trained dancer and an up-and-coming music artist. Constantly breaking boundaries, Lonsdale is sure to be an artist that’ll blow up.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Anohni</h2></div>
        
        <p>Anohni, formerly known as Antony Hegarty and the lead singer of Antony and the Johnsons, is a transgender woman with a voice resembling an angel. Her debut <i>Hopelessness</i>, is a poignant, politically-charged album that’s both haunting and beautiful. The album borders on avant-garde but isn’t too out there. With essences of R&B, electronic music and more, everyone is able to find something they’d enjoy.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">MNEK</h2></div>
        
        <p>Uzoechi Osisioma “Uzo” Emenike, better known as MNEK, has been writing and producing for the biggest names in the business (Beyonce, Madonna, Diplo) but hasn’t gotten the recognition that’s way past due for his own music. Most notably he featured on Zara Larsson’s “Never Forget You,” but his debut album <i>Language</i> is a gem of its own. <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8476392/mnek-language-album-sales"><i>Billboard</i></a> donned the album as one of the most ambitious pop albums of the year. The gay-identifying singer has pipes and it’s time for the world to recognize his talents.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Angel Haze</h2></div>
        
        <p>Raykeea Raeen-Roes Wilson, professionally known as Angel Haze, is a raw, in-your-face rapper. The pansexual rapper is a tour-de-force that exudes both vulnerability and aggressiveness in her music. With canny lyrical talent, and songs with artists like Sia and Bastille, it’s no surprise that Angel Haze has been making a name for herself in the music industry.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">MUNA</h2></div>
        
        <p>MUNA — collectively made up of Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin and Naomi McPherson — is a queer-pop band from Los Angeles. The female-pronoun-identifying members caught the eye of Harry Styles and have gone on tour with him. The trio has been compared to the likes of HAIM and even Fleetwood Mac, but they themselves have called themselves a “punk Wilson Phillips.” The band certainly exudes a sense of Stevie Nicks mixed with ’80s electronic flair.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ezra Furman</h2></div>
        
        <p>Ezra Furman’s Spotify biography pinpoints his music perfectly. The bisexual Furman “provides a soundtrack for the current fear and loathing in America,” the biography reads. Having been part of multiple bands, Furman is a seasoned musician and lyricist and it’s apparent. Touching on topics of love, sexuality, and other tough issues, Furman exudes passion and even pain in his singing. His music blends genres and doesn’t contain itself to one box. It’s inventive, just as Furman is himself.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Tash Sultana</h2></div>
        
        <p>Tash Sultana is a true virtuoso. The non-binary singer and multi-instrumentalist has been described as a one-person band. On the genre-less musician’s debut, Flow State, Sultana is the only credited musician, as well as the only producer and songwriter. Sultana blends rock, pop and even a bit of reggae to get a sound that’s 100 percent original. Singing about a variety of topics, such as mental health, the songs are able to resonate with listeners. The Australian-born singer’s story is as inspirational as it can get. Once a busker and now selling out shows across the globe, it looks like it can only go up for the Aussie.</p>
