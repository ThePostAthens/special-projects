        <p>When first arriving to Athens, freshmen may find the foreign environment daunting. Finding places where they feel comfortable, where they can find a group of friends and where they can ask questions are wants everybody feels when first arriving to campus. And for people who are LGBTQ+  these concerns may be heightened. The LGBT Center, as well as other programs through Ohio University and Athens, offers different resources for students and faculty.</p>
        
        <p>Here is a list of resources offered at Ohio University to help.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Gender Neutral Housing</h2></div>
        
        <p>Ohio University offers gender neutral housing to focus on creating a safe, inclusive living space for any student regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation and gender expression. Living in gender neutral housing does not cost more than other dorms, and the designated space is located in True House on South Green, according to OU Housing’s <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/housing/gnh_faq.cfm">website</a>. To apply, fill out the application at<a href="https://www.ohio.edu/housing/gnh_app.cfm">https://www.ohio.edu/housing/gnh_app.cfm</a> . </p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Student Names Policy</h2></div>
        
        <p>Approved in 2015, the Student Names Policy allows students to input their preferred name and pronouns in their My OHIO Student Center. The preferred names are used in classroom settings and anywhere in which a legal name is not required. Financial aid, housing contracts, admission-related processes and payroll are some areas in which legal names are still used. For more information, go to: <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/registrar/preferred-names-faqs.cfm">https://www.ohio.edu/registrar/preferred-names-faqs.cfm.</a></p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ohio University LGBT Mentoring Program</h2></div>
        
        <p>Mentoring is available for students through the LGBT Center. The program lasts a year, and students can sign up to be both mentors and mentees to provide each other with support and social connection. For more information, go to:<a href="https://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/mentorship.cfm">https://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/mentorship.cfm.</a></p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Scholarships</h2></div>
        
        <p>Currently, at least two scholarships are available to LGBTQ students, including the Wayne Hadley Scholarship Fund’s LGBT Travel Award, which is for OU students who have plans to travel. Recipients can receive up to $1,000. The second scholarship available is the Tom and Jan Hodson LGBT Student Support Fund, which was created to support LGBTQ students who have experienced financial hardship after coming out to their families. For more information, go to: <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/scholarship.cfm">https://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/scholarship.cfm</a></p>
