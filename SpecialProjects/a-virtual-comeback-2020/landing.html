            <p>A Twitter video showing three Athens Police Department officers pinning down a man on Sept. 29, 2019 caused outrage from users, according to a previous Post report. </p>

            <p>The video, which was tweeted by Jiy Brooks, shows the officers pinning a man face-first on the Court Street bricks. Other people can be heard yelling at police from the sidewalk as the victim was pinned. </p>

            <p>Brooks said she was walking down the street around 1 a.m. when she saw the victim near a car with a group of friends. She then saw cops coming up to the car and heard the victim say, “What did I do?” while putting his hands up, according to the same Post report. </p>

            <p>Several Ohio University student organizations, including Black Student Union and Black Student Communication Caucus, responded to the tweet, saying the force used was unnecessary.</p>

            <p>About 400 people gathered in front of Baker Center to see Bennett, a viral gun rights activist turned conservative media figure.</p>

            <p>After the visit, Bennett tweeted a video of students shouting at her truck, taking videos, throwing drinks into the open window and giving the group the middle finger.</p>

            <p>OUPD said in a statement later the incident didn’t rise to the level of a riot, and no one was arrested.

            <p>OU announced March 13 that it will move all campuses to remote and online instruction until the end of Spring Semester due to the coronavirus, according to a previous Post report. </p>

            <p>As a result, local businesses were in jeopardy because they didn’t have the student traffic. Those not in jeopardy have made it their mission to give back.</p>

            <p>Avalanche Pizza, 329 E. State St., and Brenen’s Coffee Cafe, 38 S. Court St., have both been giving out free lunches to help those in need during the closures. </p>

            <p>Josh Thomas, co-owner of Brenen’s, said when the schools were out and OU administration sent students home, his good friend, Brent Hartman, who runs O'Nail Hartman Insurance Agency, wanted to buy lunches that Brenen’s would then give out for free.</p>

            <p>“Immediately, we had other community members, other local businesses, anybody that recognized the pandemic wasn't really affecting them financially,” Thomas said. “We had those types of people just started giving us a call and saying we also would like to help; we'd like to help Brenen’s, but we also want to help the community.”</p>

            <p>As far as a need for the lunches in the fall, Thomas said Brenen’s will take it day by day. </p>

            <p>“We certainly still have some people in town that need the meals and that need is never going to go away. And we recognize that. We've had a lot of other people recognize that, too, and still want to help. If it's something we can continue to do and make it work, then I'm sure we'll be happy to do that,” Thomas said.

            <p>Earlier in the semester, Shively Court will be closing permanently due to the low enrollment prediction for the Fall Semester.

                <p>The decision to shut down the dining hall most notable for its “Grab N Go” option was made before the coronavirus pandemic began, according to a previous Post report.</p>

                <p>Katie Brown, a senior studying integrated media, was a student leader for three semesters at Shively Court. Brown found out about the dining hall closing first from the office assistants in a student leader GroupMe, she said in an Instagram direct message.</p>

                <p>“Usually that's the case: that if you go from being a student leader at one hall to working at another hall, you will basically start from the beginning/not be a student leader,” Brown said in an Instagram direct messaage. “ …someone from Nelson reached out to me and reassured me that I would be able to work at either of the dining halls as a student leader because of the unique circumstances.”</p>

                <p>Brown was going to work at the District on West Green, but now because of OU's phased learning, the managers have said they can't hire student employees during phase one, so she’s unsure.</p>

            <h2 class="t-arthed">Pandemic sparks unique social media activism</h2>
            <p>The loss of students on campus because of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the creation of multiple online efforts to raise awareness about OU’s alleged budget crisis. </p>

            <p>The Save OUr Professors movement was created April 30 by Olivia Gemarro, a senior studying English creative writing and sociology-criminology pre-law. Gemarro said she was frustrated with information about professor cuts being spread and wanted to make the greater community more aware of it. The account has gotten attention from all demographics of the OU community, according to a previous Post report. </p>

            <p>Alumni have also become prevalent in budget conversations. A group of alumni started the My OHIO Is… website, where people can submit their personal testimonies of what OU means to them. The hope is to unite the community under a shared vision of OU amid talks of budget cuts, according to a previous Post report. </p>

            <p>A lot of testimonials have been submitted so far, Henry Kessler, a 2015 OU alumnus who studied art history and helped create the website, said. Kessler hopes the stories show communities and not just classrooms are being affected.</p>

            <p>The main goal of the event was for OU to implement a firing freeze. The freeze would halt non-renewals, reinstate COVID-19 layoffs and cap salaries at the equivalent of Gov. Mike DeWine’s salary, according to a previous Post report. </p>

            <p>Be on the lookout for North End Kitchen + Bar and Grub-N-Go around Athens.</p>

            <p>A Cornwell family-owned restaurant will go in the location of the former Cornwell Jewelers, 77 N. Court St., according to a previous Post report.</p>

            <p>David and Jen Cornwell are opening North End Kitchen + Bar, an open-air street taco restaurant. </p>

            <p>“I think that this will be fun: being able to have the different salsas and the smaller street tacos,” Jen said in the previous Post report. “You come in, and you can get two or three different ones, depending on how hungry you are.”</p>

            <p>North End Kitchen + Bar isn’t the only eatery new to Athens. </p>

            <p>In May, Uptown Grill, 11 W. Union St., changed its name to Grub-N-Go and is under new ownership, according to a previous Post report. Grub-N-Go is run by Athens local Todd Thompson. The restaurant is family-owned and family-run. Thompson is working with his son, his daughter and his daughter-in-law.</p>

            <p>Thompson has an all-day breakfast and lunch/dinner menu, and due to popular demand, he brought the chicken and waffles back. </p>

            <p>“There was such an outpouring on social media about the chicken and waffles being gone,” Thompson said. “And the thing was, I had no clue about chicken and waffles, so I decided to come up with my own sauce, so the sauce is different. I have been told that it's better than the previous sauce. I'm excited about it, and we seem to sell them well.”</p>

            <p>The campus favorite drunk food is not on the menu, but it is on the sidewalk sign. A regular chicken and waffle sandwich is $6.50, and a chicken and waffle with bacon is $7. </p>

            <p>“It's going to be permanent. People will be able to order it any time they want, all day long, even breakfast if they want it for breakfast,” Thompson said.</p>

            <p>About 81 employee positions were eliminated June 23 in OU’s final mass personnel reduction.</p>

            <p>There were 63 classified positions, 17 administrative positions and one hourly research position that was considered unclassified impacted by the reduction. Employees in 23 of the former positions will be rehired after departments are reorganized, according to a previous Post report.</p>

            <p>The bulk of positions eliminated were in the College of Arts and Sciences.

            <p>Tensions ran high July 5 when two rallies collided on Court Street.</p>

            <p>A rally titled Defend The Police began at noon and was later met with counterprotesters Uptown. There were more attending the counter protest, Defend OUr Community, but State Rep. Jay Edwards, R-Nelsonville, attended the Defend The Police Event. </p>

            <p>Edwards said he thinks the majority of people in Southeast Ohio and Appalachia do not support defunding the police, according to a previous Post report. </p>

            <p>“We got to do better at trying to weed out the bad apples, but defunding a police is the absolute opposite thing you can do,” Edwards said in that same Post report.</p>

            <p>The majority of those attending the counter protest were students and of the younger demographic. Those at Defend The Police tended to be older residents in Athens.

            <h2 class="t-arthed">Social media account pops up to spread sexual assault awareness</h2>
            <p>The “Matthew Bode Victims” account drew significant attention on Instagram after a survivor shared their story July 30.</p>

            <p>In the post, the survivor, who is remaining completely anonymous, wrote that she visited OU on Sept. 6, 2019, and was invited to a Pi Kappa Phi frat party at Bode’s house. There, she had two drinks and didn’t feel well. She slept in the house and woke up naked from the waist down and a condom on the floor. The post has gotten over 111,000 likes and more than 12,000 comments. </p>
            
            <p>“I had stayed quiet for far too long and it went unnoticed for longer than it ever should have,” the survivor said in an Instagram direct message. “My goal was to show other women like me that you have a voice too. We should not have to be silent over something we couldn’t control.”</p>

            <p>The creator of the account and another woman who saw the account and felt encouraged to speak up make up two accusations against Bode. Anonymous pressed charges in September and in June, and Bode was arrested. According to NBC4 Columbus, Bode is being held on a $250,000 bond for two charges of first-degree felony rape. The survivor called Jenny Hall-Jones recently and was told that because the rape was out of OUPD’s jurisdiction, she had to go to the Athens Police Department.</p>

            <p>The survivor started a change.org petition to create a platform for change.
