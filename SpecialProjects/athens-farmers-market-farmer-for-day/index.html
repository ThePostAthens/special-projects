        here is nothing quite like fresh produce: bright, colorful greens; aromatic, delicate herbs; and swollen fruits bursting with sweetness. All of these can be found weekly at Athens’ own <a target="blank" href="https://www.athensfarmersmarket.org/">Farmers Market</a>. For those invested in buying and eating local foods, they now have a chance to help out. 
    </p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The Athens Farmers Market <a target="blank" href="https://www.athensfarmersmarket.org/farmer-for-a-day-program">Farmer for a Day Program</a> is an opportunity for people to get hands-on experience working at a local farm for a day. The program was the idea of Ed Perkins, president of the Athens Farmers Market executive committee and owner of <a target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SassafrasFarmOH/">Sassafras Farm</a>, 10940 Lightfritz Ridge Road, New Marshfield.</p>
        
        <p>“(Farmer for a Day was) just a way to learn and experience a wide range of farms in this area,” Perkins said.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/31e4d125-6043-4e8b-9177-d496f3e8650b.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="Adam Blaney removes frost-stricken cabbages from the greenhouse on his farm in Albany, Ohio, on March 2, 2020." style="width: 100%"> <p class="pcut">Adam Blaney removes frost-stricken cabbages from the greenhouse on his farm in Albany, Ohio, on March 2, 2020.</p> </div>
        
        <p>Sassafras Farms grows herbs, vegetables and small fruits year-round. Each day at the farm is different. Farmers for a day would join Perkins in a variety of activities –– from weeding to transplanting to harvesting and market preparation.</p>
        
        <p>The program is going on its third year. It’s been a way for students who are interested in farming to see what it’s like, Perkins said. Though there have been participants, Perkins wishes more people would take advantage of the program.</p>
        
        <p>“We want more people to participate,” Perkins said. “It’s a way for us farmers to connect to the community.”</p>
        
        <p>Perkins added that Farmer for a Day has a wide range of participating farms.</p>
        
        <p>“If somebody is interested in farming, they could get a wide variety of experience,” Perkins said. “(There’s) all sorts of things: orchards, apples, peaches and pruning; chickens and collecting eggs, herb growers, picking herbs. There's a maple syrup farm, too.”</p>
        
        <p><a target= "blank" href="https://www.blaneyfamilyfarm.com/?fbclid=IwAR1KxasfS1k1gvY2dTQ5fuRBuulAtbk98mcY_DP0FBjkjxyv7mbWjdDOMHc">Blaney Family Farm</a>, 29760 State Route 143, Albany, is a vegetable farm that participates in the Farmer for a Day program.</p>
        
        <p>Adam Blaney, of Blaney Family Farm, said his farm wouldn’t really exist without volunteering. He didn’t grow up gardening, but he fell in love with the agricultural lifestyle after a volunteering experience in West Virginia.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/99fc711f-1e0d-4bde-a7d0-073d8604c6cd.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="Adam Blaney plays with his dog, on his farm in Albany, Ohio, on March 2, 2020." style="width: 100%"><p class="pcut">Adam Blaney plays with his dog, on his farm in Albany, Ohio, on March 2, 2020.</p> </div>
        
        <p>Blaney Family Farm is a newcomer to the Athens Farmers Market. This past February marked its one-year anniversary. Blaney Family Farm had a successful first year, Blaney said.</p>
        
        <p>Blaney Family Farm is built on the idea of farms being a part of the local economy. The farm is a member of <a target="blank" href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/community-supported-agriculture">Community Supported Agriculture</a>, a method for purchasing products directly from farmers.</p>
        
        <p>“Our goal is to build community through local agriculture,” Blaney said. “Everything we do, we want to do through (the) local community. To us, a farm is a great place for which a community can be built around.”</p>
        
        <p>Blaney stressed that a “local mindset” is very important for Blaney Family Farm. Blaney said buying produce from him puts shoes on his children’s feet –– rather than outsourced produce from a corporate grocery store.</p>
        
        <p>Blaney Family Farm provides lettuce and greens to local businesses like Kindred Market, 284 E. State St., and the Lake Hope Lodge, 27331 OH-278, McArthur.</p>
        
        <p>Like Sassafras Farm, tasks for each day at Blaney’s farm varies. But one thing’s for sure: participants can expect to be treated like family for a day at Blaney Family Farm.</p>
        
        <p>“If people come out and work, (they’ll) eat breakfast and lunch with us and our family,” Blaney said.</p>
        
        <p>Participation in Farmer for a Day has led to internships and job opportunities, Becky Clark, promotions director for the Athens Farmers Market, said. In fact, most farmers are happy to have visitors.</p>
        
        <p>“Most (farmers) are willing and excited to show people around,” Clark said.</p>
        
        <p>For Clark, Farmer for a Day is a way for people to get outside of Athens and see how people are making a living out of food and farming.</p>
        
        <p>“Farming is cool,” Clark said. “It connects people more with (their) local food system.”</p>
