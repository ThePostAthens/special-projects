        <p>I have a confession to make. I’m a terrible college sports fan. I leave at halftime, sometimes earlier, if the stadium seats are too cold or if I finish my popcorn too quickly.</p>

        <p>Despite being a person who genuinely enjoys watching basketball, I haven’t been to a single Bobcats game during my college career. I can’t help but feel a little guilty each time I pass by the corner of Court and Union and see Norm Emmets asking passing students if they’re planning to attend that evening’s game.</p>

        <p>When I was first announced as editor of The Post nearly a year ago, I was met with an uncomfortable realization — I’d have to learn a thing or two, not only about sports, but about sportswriting. Although I’d regularly sat five feet away from the sports desk for about three years, I was hopelessly clueless about the inner workings of Ohio Athletics.</p>

        <p>They spoke using foreign terms like “gamer” and “non-conference play.” Meanwhile, I regularly confused Saul Phillips and Frank Solich and I was guilty of skipping through the sports section each time I’d pick up a copy of the paper (sorry, Spencer and Pete).</p>

        <p>To my untrained eyes, sports journalism was an oxymoron of sorts. It was what my dad read over eggs and bacon on a Sunday morning while I did the crossword puzzle.</p>

        <p>But taking on a leadership position in our newsroom meant I’d have to finally face my own ignorance when it came to understanding and appreciating sports journalism. So, on a Wednesday night during Fall Semester, I planted myself at a production computer to make my way through a volleyball story. And immediately, to my own surprise, I was hooked.</p>

        <p>The writer wasn’t just regurgitating the facts or giving a play-by-play. Instead, the game came alive. The players were characters in a larger, dynamic narrative. My entire perspective on sports journalism changed with a single story.</p>

        <p>Later that winter, when Ohio played San Diego State in the Frisco Bowl, I made sure I was front and center in front of the TV at my hometown brewery to watch the game. At first, I was the only one watching. But soon, a small crowd began to build.</p>

        <p>Most of them were middle-aged men, reminiscing on their own days in Athens, asking me if their favorite bar still existed Uptown or if their old dorm was still standing. Others told me they had kids attending OU. Though we were strangers separated by age and experience, we found sense of community as we cheered our team on to victory.</p>

        <p>We may not be a Big 10 school. The Convo’s grandstands may never look like they used to. But that’s OK. At the end of the day, our teams brings us together when it can be difficult to find common ground. And here at The Post, our talented team of sports reporters and photographers will always be on the sidelines to capture the action.</p>

        <p>Once again, we’re thrilled to present the annual basketball issue.</p>
