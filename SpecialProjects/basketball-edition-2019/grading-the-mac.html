        <p>With only two weeks remaining, the race for the regular season Mid-American Conference title is heating up.</p>

        <p>As good as Buffalo is, the Bulls haven’t wrapped up the regular season title or the No. 1 seed in the MAC Tournament yet. They actually aren’t even in first right now. There’s also a logjam in the middle for the potential first-round home games in the MAC Tournament.</p>

        <p>With only two weeks until the conference tournament arrives in Cleveland, The Post released its Feb. 20 power rankings:</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Buffalo (23-3, 11-2 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The Bulls are a machine, and they take no prisoners. That was on display against Ohio on Tuesday night, when they beat the Bobcats by 47 and made 19 3s. They also went on the road last week and escaped Toledo in Savage Arena. If the MAC Tournament started today, Buffalo would be the No. 2 seed, however, due to that loss to Bowling Green.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Bowling Green (19-7, 11-2 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>Take the good with the bad when it comes to the Falcons. The good? If the season ended today, Bowling Green would be the MAC regular season champs for the first time since 2009. The bad? The Falcons will have to go to Buffalo on March 8 to claim that title. They’ll face Ohio on Friday night in The Convo.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Toledo (20-6, 8-5 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The Rockets were 20-4, and they appeared to be up for the challenge of competing with Buffalo. But the Bulls went on the road and beat Toledo in the Rockets’ house. Now after a road loss to Eastern Michigan on Tuesday, Toledo could use a win to get back on track. Northern Illinois on Saturday seems to be just what the doctor ordered.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Kent State (19-7, 8-5 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>Kent State could have leaped Toledo if the Golden Flashes beat Central Michigan on Tuesday, but the Flashes were upset by the Chippewas. Right now, they’re holding on to that No. 3 seed, but another slip-up could drop them from the top four.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Central Michigan (18-8, 7-6 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>Speaking of Central Michigan, the Chippewas are inching their way toward a top-four seeding after the win over Kent State. They’ll have a good chance to beat Ball State and Eastern Michigan, both on the road, before hosting Toledo. That game on March 2 could determine a lot in the conference.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Miami (14-12, 6-7 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The RedHawks are entering the toughest stretch of their season. They’ll go to Akron this weekend, then travel to Bowling Green before hosting Buffalo. If they go 0-3 in that span, they may drop below the eight-seed line, forcing them into a road game in the first round of the MAC Tournament.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Akron (14-12, 6-7 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The Zips are in a similar situation, but they don’t have quite the daunting schedule Miami has. They’ve lost their last three games by a combined 11 points, and the game with Miami looms large on the schedule this weekend. They’re getting close to a win, but it just hasn’t worked out lately.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Eastern Michigan (12-14, 6-7 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>If there’s a team with a chance to move up, it’s Eastern Michigan. The Eagles will host Western Michigan and Central Michigan in their next two games, and if they can win both, they’ll put themselves in control of hosting a first-round game.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Northern Illinois (12-14, 5-8 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The Huskies are on a five-game skid, and it doesn’t get much easier. They’ll head to Toledo for a weekend game against the MAC West’s best. A reason to be positive? At least Eugene German’s suspension only lasted one game. They’d travel to Eastern Michigan if the tournament started now.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ball State (14-12, 5-8 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The Cardinals nearly beat Miami on Tuesday, but came up just short. Their 5-8 record in the MAC isn’t the worst, but in a schedule littered with close losses, they seem to be near good enough to compete.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ohio (11-14, 3-10 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The Bobcats suffered their second-worst loss in program history against Buffalo on Tuesday night. The Bulls nearly beat them by 50, and it was ugly. Ohio hasn’t won a game since Jan. 26, and Bowling Green, who is up next for the Bobcats, isn’t a pushover. The losing streak may reach a month.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Western Michigan (8-18, 2-11 MAC)</h2></div>

        <p>The only reason the Broncos are still in the basement instead of the Bobcats is because of the record. If the tournament started right now, Western Michigan would make the trip to Mount Pleasant, Michigan, to play Central Michigan.</p>
