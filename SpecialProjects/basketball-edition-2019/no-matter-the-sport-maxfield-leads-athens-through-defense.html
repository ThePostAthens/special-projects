        <p>Athens needed to make a change at halftime of its Jan. 18 game against Vinton County.</p>

        <p>Vikings guard Gavin Arbaugh had scored 18 points in the first half against the Bulldogs’ zone defense. The Bulldogs had only scored 15 points as a team in the first 16 minutes.</p>

        <p>Logan Maxfield was mad that Arbaugh had outscored Athens, so he asked Bulldogs coach Mickey Cozart if he could guard Arbaugh. With Maxfield guarding Arbaugh full-court, Arbaugh only scored two points in the second half. Although Vinton County went on to win the game late in the fourth quarter, Maxfield gave Athens a chance to win near the end with his defense.</p>

        <p>It was Athens only loss in Tri-Valley Conference-Ohio this season, and after the loss, the Bulldogs won the following seven games to clinch the TVC-Ohio title for the first time since 2015.</p>

        <p>Since then, Maxfield has guarded the opponent’s best player. Doing that has kept Athens from constantly playing in its typical zone defense, but it has helped it shut down other teams.</p>

        <p>“It helps a lot because it keeps the ball out their guys hands,” Maxfield said. “(The opponent is) going to get sloppy and make mistakes, so you'll be able to push the ball.”</p>

        <p>Whether it is a zone or man defense, Maxfield plays aggressively to prevent opponents from getting in rhythm and having easy shots.</p>

        <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/cb0f8af6-9440-4bf1-9e15-8da713399daf.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Colin Mayr | FOR THE POST</p><p class="pcut">Athens Bulldogs point guard Elijah Williams (no. 3) goes for a layup during the first half of the Bulldogs game against Meigs High School on Friday, Feb 8, 2019. The Bulldogs won 55-51 and clinched the Tri-Valley Conference with the win.
</p> </div>

        <p>He is one of the best on-ball defenders for Athens, Cozart said, and is key to them being able to shut teams down. He won’t give the opponent any space and will be looking for opportunities when he is able to knock the ball away.</p>

        <p>In the zone defense, Maxfield is able to protect passing lanes and deflect passes. He can quickly close out opponents as teams try to find space to shoot.</p>

        <p>Any time the ball is loose, Maxfield will be the first one to dive on the floor, trying to save a possession or help Athens force a turnover.</p>

        <p>Whenever Athens is able to create a turnover, it tries to run the fast break with Maxfield and point guard Elijah Williams. They are able to react quickly to the turnover and run out ahead of the opponent for an easy layup.</p>

        <p>Even if it is a contested layup, Maxfield is able to use his physicality to create separation to make the shot or draw a foul.</p>

        <p>The steals and fast-breaks are a main way Maxfield scores his points, but he’s also able to make his shots in the half-court offense.</p>

        <p>He is able to drive by his man for layups and create separation for 3-pointers. Athens has two big post players, and defenses collapsing on them makes knocking down 3-pointers crucial for the offense.</p>

        <p>When Athens needs someone to take charge of the offense, it’s often Maxfield is doing so.</p>

        <p>In a game to decide the TVC-Ohio title against Alexander, it was a three-point game going into the fourth quarter when Maxfield scored back-to-back layups. He then made a 3-pointer to give all the momentum to Athens — and led to a 15-point win.</p>

        <p>“He did what great players do, he took control of everything,” Cozart said.</p>

        <p>Now that the regular season is over, the next loss will be the final basketball game of Maxfield’s career. He will attend college to play football in the fall.</p>

        <p>Maxfield signed his National Letter of Intent to play football for Division III Marietta College on Feb. 1. Marietta plays in the Ohio Athletic Conference that includes on of the best Division III schools in the country, Mount Union.</p>

        <p>There were four colleges that offered Maxfield a chance to play collegiate football, and the Pioneers have had recent success with six- and seven-win seasons the last two years.</p>

        <p>For Athens, Maxfield was the 2018 TVC Defensive Player of the Year and a first team all-conference selection. The outside linebacker had 36 tackles and 14 assists in his senior season along with four interceptions and one forced fumble.</p>

        <p>Maxfield also played wide receiver, where he had 520 receiving yards and five touchdowns in his senior season.</p>

        <p>During the football season, there is little time to practice basketball, so it takes some adjusting once the football season is over. That could frustrate Maxfield, but he has enough experience to know that it’ll just take time for him to get adjusted back to playing basketball.</p>

        <p>“I wasn't hitting my shots at all like the first few days or week,” Maxfield said. “I was getting frustrated, but I knew it would take time."</p>

        <p>By the time the games came around, Maxfield had found his rhythm and adjusted to basketball. He scored 48 points in the first four games and led the team in scoring in two of the games, including 20 in a 63-57 win over Chesapeake.</p>

        <p>Knowing that he would be playing football in college, Maxfield could have not played basketball to avoid injury and focus on preparing for the fall. He had multiple reasons to continue playing, even though he could get injured.</p>

        <p>“Coaches in college love multi-sport athletes, so they want you to keep playing,” Maxfield said. “I know I have a place that's going to keep me in shape and keep me busy staying out of trouble."</p>

        <p>As he goes through his senior year, Maxfield is happy he decided to play and experience his final season with his teammates.</p>

        <p>“I know I would have regretted it if I was going to watch them play on Friday night and not being with them,” Maxfield said.</p>

        <p>Cozart is glad to have Maxfield on the court, shutting down opponent’s best players and reliably scoring for Athens.</p>
