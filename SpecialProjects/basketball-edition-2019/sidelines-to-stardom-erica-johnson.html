        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>Erica Johnson lowered the white leg sleeve on her left knee after practice Monday at The Convo.</p>

        <p>She needed to let her body breathe after an intense 80-minute practice, but as she adjusted the white sleeve, she revealed a series of scars that hid the four broken screws still inserted in her surgically repaired knee.</p>

        <p>Johnson, however, felt no pain. She’s proved to be one of the toughest players for Ohio this year, and after she endured two years without a single minute of game action, the redshirt freshman has become one of the most lethal players for the Bobcats.</p>

        <p>But it came with a price. The scars and screws, which safely remained in her knee after her second surgery in less than four years, are all she has left to show for the pain and patience she experienced before she was finally penciled into the lineup.</p>

        <p>“I was a dog waiting in the cage to come out,” Johnson said. “It was extremely hard, especially mentally. It's great to finally see it all come together. This is what I've been working for.”
</p>

        <p>Without Johnson, Ohio likely wouldn’t be atop the Mid-American Conference, and its offense wouldn’t carry the same punch that’s placed it No. 1 in the MAC. The 5-foot-11 point guard is second on Ohio with 14 points per game, first with six rebounds per game and fourth with a 40.4 percentage from 3-point range.
</p>

        <p>Her ability to shoot the ball from anywhere on the court was a weapon Ohio lacked last year when it went 16-15 and failed to make it out of the second round in the MAC Tournament. Johnson was eight months removed from a second knee surgery when Boldon decided to redshirt her before last season.</p>

        <p>Johnson suffered from an osteochondral defect, which is when a joint suffers from a lack of cartilage support. It limited the growth of her knee and, after the first surgery, forced her to sacrifice her entire high school sophomore season at Mansfield High School and the last half of her senior year.</p>

        <p>Doctors were surprised to see that Johnson, who began playing basketball in fourth grade, lasted until high school without suffering further pain. Johnson wanted to fight through it, however, and accomplish her biggest goal — eclipse 1,000 points. She was at 847 and was confident that she’d reach it in her final month in high school.</p>

        <p>Her parents thought differently. </p>

        <p>“It’s a blessing that she was even able to play,” said Katrina Douglas, Johnson’s mom. “She had to let her knee heal, and just the fact that she was able to play was a miracle.”</p>

        <p>Johnson accepted her offer from Boldon in her junior year, and her parents wanted her to focus on her future with the Bobcats. That meant forgoing the rest of the senior year for another surgery to address the pain.</p>

        <p>Johnson begged her parents until her dad, Eric Johnson, told her about their decision.</p>

        <p>“No. You’re done,” he said. “I went and told the coach that we would not allow her to play again, because she would have continued to play her. Even though she was laboring real bad, we said no.”</p>

        <p>Johnson shook her head and said she understood, but deep down, she was crushed.</p>

        <p>“That was a tough pill to swallow,” Johnson said. “I had to think about my college career and about my life in general.”</p>

        <blockquote class="pq_right">“It was really mentally tough. The aspect of knowing I can get this many points a game. We had a big rebounding problem last year. I can be out there rebounding. I can be out there doing this, doing that — helping my team. That was extremely frustrating.”<span class="attribution">Erica Johnson</span></blockquote>

        <p> Her next chapter was Ohio, where Boldon wanted to have Johnson play as much as possible. She could have played in small portions as a true freshman, but Boldon felt that was a waste. He needed four full years of Johnson, and he didn’t want to risk long-term damage to her knee.</p>

        <p>So she sat on the bench and watched as her teammates struggled to accomplish what she could do best — rebound and score.</p>

        <p>“It was hard sometimes watching her just kill us in practice and knowing that she could help us win games,” Boldon said. “Whatever years I get to coach Erica, I want her to play as many games as possible that year. Whether it's 30, 32 or 35, however many we got to play this year. I didn't want it to be 12. That's not a good use of her skill set.”</p>

        <p>Johnson hated the bench. She understood Boldon’s reasons for redshirting her, but she missed nearly half of her high school career nursing her knee. Ohio was supposed to be different.</p>

        <p>“It was really mentally tough,” Johnson said. “The aspect of knowing I can get this many points a game. We had a big rebounding problem last year. I can be out there rebounding. I can be out there doing this, doing that — helping my team. That was extremely frustrating.”</p>

        <p>She knew, however, that she would still play four years with the Bobcats if she found a way to stay healthy. Dak Notestine, Ohio’s women’s basketball and football strength coach, told Johnson her knee issues would vanish if she did something no other doctor mentioned before — build up her quadriceps.</p>

        <p>Johnson was shocked. A stronger quad would soften the pressure on her knee, but she didn’t know why it took nearly four years for her to learn the solution was that simple.</p>

        <p>"Where I'm from, they really don't have the resources of other schools,” Johnson said. “I didn't know at the time that they weren't preparing me, but once I got here and saw I didn't have a quad muscle, I just realized that I wasn't prepared for what I was getting myself into.”</p>

        <p>Johnson has devoted a full year to building her quad muscles. She’s taken advantage of her player-only 24-hour access to The Convo; she spends nearly three hours a day, from 7-10 p.m., doing her own workouts inside the arena.</p>

        <p>It paid off.</p>

        <p>It’s why she was able to zoom by a Western Michigan defender for an easy layup last Saturday. And a Purdue defender in December. And a Buffalo defender in January.</p>

        <p>Johnson made those moves look simple, but it was her willingness to tolerate two surgeries and another painful year from the bench that she could even be on the court.</p>

        <p>She’s averaged 30 minutes per game in her first full season and has shown Boldon a ceiling of talent he hasn’t seen since Kiyanna Black, who scored the third-most points in Ohio program history.</p>

        <p>“I don't know where she will go,” Boldon said. “I think she'll make a run at some records here. I don't know what they'll be. In that she'll be one of the best players to play here? I think so.”</p>

        <p>For now, Johnson is just thankful to play. Her knee is healthy, and she’s on a team that could go from an early MAC Tournament dropout to an NCAA Tournament appearance in one year.</p>

        <p>She still has scars that show the physical toll of her path to Ohio stardom, but the mental scars are long gone.</p>

        <p>“Nobody knows the long nights and the long hours I put in the gym and what I did and what I went through during the redshirt season,” Johnson said. “I just waited for my time. This is what I've been working for, so to be riding this wave is great for me.”</p>

        <p>The injury’s behind her. The time has been put in, and she has won over full praise from her coach.</p>

        <p>Now, it’s Erica Johnson’s turn to be great.</p>
