                <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
                <p>Southern Ohio native Charlie Haskins has been sharing his colorful and eccentric art skills in the Portsmouth area for years.
</p>

                <p>Haskins was raised in South Webster, about a 30-minute drive northeast of Portsmouth.
</p>

<div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/6417800e-32c8-4040-a1e9-86747a6d7e5d.sized-1000x1000.jpeg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Provided by Charlie Haskin</p><p class="pcut">Charlie Haskin's artwork.</p> </div>
<br><br>

                <p>Last year, Haskins had an exhibit at Ohio University’s Southern Campus, located in Ironton.
</p>

                <p>“It was possibly my favorite exhibit I’ve done. I took it as an opportunity to show off my weirder stuff,” Haskins said. “In the show, I had paintings, sculptures and even made some puppets that hung from the gallery’s ceiling.”
</p>

                <p>Haskins’ art style consists of creating a story.
</p>

                <p>“Someone once told me that my painting looked like what Dr. Seuss would make if he had taken a little too much cough syrup, and I tend to agree,” he said.
</p>

                <p>Haskins is a fourth-generation artist. He said art is his “obsession” and that he is always working on different sketches and drawings — sometimes even on napkins and scrap paper.
</p>

<br><br>

                <p>“I think I keep making things because it’s how I learn and explore new ideas,” Haskins said.
</p>

                <p>While folklore legends such as Bigfoot, mermaids and the man in the moon have a large influence on Haskins’ work, he is also really influenced by his mother.
</p>

                <p>“She has always encouraged me to try new media and to keep the act of art making in my day-to-day life,” he said.
</p>

                <p>Haskins’ work has been displayed at the Geer Museum and Southern Ohio Museum, as well as events like Comic Con, Nelsonville Music Festival and the Irving Halloween Festival.
</p>

<br><br>

                <p>One of Haskins’ favorite parts about events, such as festivals and conventions, is setting up the exhibits.
</p>

                <p>He has been awarded with the Outstanding Individual Artist award from the Portsmouth Area Arts Council.
</p>

                <p>Haskins believes the role of an artist is a big responsibility in the community.
</p>

<br><br>

                <p>“They can preserve the past with their work. They improve upon the past. They can make new works. But for me, I think the biggest role as an artist is to take invisible things, like ideas and feelings, and make them tangible,” Haskins said.
</p>

                <p>In the future, Haskins plans to publish a book filled with a collection of “ghost paintings.” He has been working on that series for a couple of years.
</p>

                <p>“I hope to continue to create books,” Haskins said.
</p>
