        <p>Democrat Incumbent Sherrod Brown won the Senate race against Republican Jim Renacci, beating his challenger 52.72%-47.28% with 94.35% of precincts reporting in Ohio. This will be Senator Brown’s third term.</p>
        
        <p>“Tonight, Ohio, you showed the country that by putting people first and by honoring the dignity of work, we can carry a state Donald Trump won by nearly 10 points,” Brown said in his victory speech.</p>
        
        <p>One third of the U.S. Senate was up for re-election this midterm election. 26 Democrats (including two Independents who caucus with the Democratic Party) and nine Republicans.</p>
        
        <p>“We've seen so much energy this year from Ohioans who are fighting to defend healthcare, keep our communities safe and protect the progress we have made,” Sherrod Brown said in an email about “The Blue Wave.”</p>
        
        <p>“I think the Blue Wave is beneficial for everyone,” Lily Gregorian, sophomore studying biology said.</p>
        
        <p>Senator Brown was born and raised in Mansfield, Ohio. Prior to his first Senate Election, Brown was a member of the Ohio General Assembly and served as Ohio’s Secretary of State and represented Ohio’s 13th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/d2a2fe25-468e-4cdd-b56c-e239daba6710.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Emilee Chinn | PHOTO EDITOR</p><p class="pcut">Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, speaks at the Students for Sherrod event in Baker Center on Aug. 29. (FILE) </p> </div>

        
        <p>Senator Brown has spent his campaign travelling around the state and holding events to talk with voters about the issues they care the most about. Brown also talked to voters about what he’s going to do to make sure all Ohioans can get ahead.</p>
        
        <p>“The single biggest problem facing Ohioans is that as they work harder than ever, they have less and less to show for the work they put in,” Brown said in an email. “I’m fighting to make sure every single Ohioan has the opportunity to succeed -- from the first-generation college student working their way through school at OU, to the nurse in Cincinnati or the business owner in Sandusky.”</p>
        
        <p>One of Senator Brown’s main focuses in his political career has been standing up for American workers. He has spent his career fighting to make sure Ohioans see their work pay off by investing in job-training programs. He’s also attempted to make it easier for student borrowers to refinance their loans. Brown said in an email that he has also fought to raise wages and wants to make sure workers “have a seat at the table and the ability to organize and bargain.”</p>
        
        <p> “Above all, I believe there is dignity in all work,” Brown said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>Senator Brown made the opioid epidemic also one of his main concerns. Brown has been working with fellow Senator Rob Portman, R-OH. to make it easier for Ohioans battling addiction to receive treatment. Ohio has the second highest opioid overdose death rate per state, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html">CDC</a>.</p>
        
        <p>“I hear from Ohioans on the frontlines of this epidemic everyday and they need Congress to step up and provide the resources they need to make an impact in their communities,” Brown said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>Creating jobs is one of Senator Brown’s top priorities for his next term. He is pursuing new policies that will support U.S. job creation, Brown said in an email. Some of these policies include renegotiating trades so they work better for Ohioans to tax incentives for companies who keep jobs in the U.S.</p>
        
        <p>“While we invest in workers, we must also invest in communities to create new jobs and new opportunities for Ohioans,” Brown said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>Senator Brown was predicted to win this race by 15 points, according to CNN. In 2012, Brown beat Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel by 6 points in the Senate race.</p>
        
        <p>“This is the most important election of our lifetimes because every other election has passed and is relevant at this point. We have to focus on now. This is the most important one that we have to focus on and we have to break away from the current trajectory that President Trump has taken taken this country on. We really need to write the ship and get it going back on the right direction,” Bailey Williams, president of Ohio University College Democrats said.</p>
        
        <p>For the past 11 years, Ohio has had a Democratic Senator and a Republican Senator. Before this election, only 14 states had a Senator from each of the main political parties, according to <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/04/split-u-s-senate-delegations-have-become-less-common-in-recent-years/">Pew Research Center.</a></p>
        
        <p>“I think for Ohio it’s fair. If you’re a Republican, you have your views that can be heard in the Senate, and if you’re a Democrat, your views can be heard in the Senate as well. I think it’s good for Ohio. We’re a swing state, we have a lot of views that are different, and I think maintaining both makes it fair for everyone,” Alex Herges, junior studying sports management said.</p>
        
        <p>Brown defeated Congressman Renacci who had been in the U.S. House Representatives for Ohio’s 16th district since 2010. Before his career in politics, he was a businessman and operated over 60 businesses. He created 1,500 new jobs and employed 3,000 people statewide, according to his campaign website.</p>
        
        <p>“For my lifetime (this is the most important election cycle) because of the political tension that is going on right now. People are making things super divided, I don’t think we are as (divided as) it appears on social media,” Missy Pedulla, president of Ohio University College Republicans said.</p>
        
        <p>Senator Brown spent election night in Columbus with his family and fellow Democratic candidates.</p>
        
        <p>“I have spent my career fighting for working families across our state,” Brown said in an email. “I am proud that Ohioans know me, know my record, and know that they can count on me to give them a voice in the Senate.”</p>
