        <p>If you ask someone in politics, they’ll probably say all elections matter. But for some, the 2018 midterm elections just feel different.</p>
        
        <p>Nationally, the elections will decide which political party is in control of Congress. On a state level, Ohioans will see a new governor and fresh faces in the Statehouse and in other areas of state politics. In Athens, voters have the power to decide the fate of schools in their district and who becomes a county commissioner. Few, if any, people in politics would say those things are anything but irrelevant, however there’s still something distinct about this election.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past few years, politics have become more polarized and more personal. The rise of movements like “March for Our Lives” and “#MeToo” have put social issues to the forefront of the political discussion. While some voters are concerned about the state of the economy, health care policies and immigration. To some, however, this election is about deciding the future of the country, what it values and where it will go.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">An opportunity to be seen and heard</h2></div>
        
        <p>Washington, D.C., is about 350 miles from Athens, and while some may think what happens in Washington doesn’t have too big of an impact on their own lives, this year’s election could have a tremendous one.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/04/midterm-election-whats-stake-where-vote-poll-hours-rules-locations-results/1826145002/"><i>USA Today</i> reported</a> that this year’s election “won't just decide who takes control of the House or Senate. The midterms are seen in large part as a referendum of President Donald Trump, whose two years as president have been tainted with controversy and scandal.” Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/this-midterm-election-is-like-no-other-in-a-generation/2018/11/04/dd92e236-df9d-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html?utm_term=.f9f6ba127150"><i>Washington Post</i></a> reports that this election is unlike any other in recent history.</p>
        
        <p>For Ohio University Student Senate President Maddie Sloat, this election is an opportunity to halt what she sees as an unraveling of progress in the areas of civil rights and women’s issues. Sloat said her opinions as a politically involved person are separate from her work in Student Senate.</p>
        
        <p>“As a young woman who’s worked to promote civil rights and women’s issues for years now, feeling like so much of the work that our country has done to make progress in these areas has been undone in such a short time is a difficult pill to swallow,” she said. “So for me, this election is an opportunity to halt that as soon as possible, and start making change in the right direction again.”</p>
        
        <p>Sloat isn’t alone in that realm of thinking. Activists on both sides of the political spectrum have poured countless hours, days, weeks and months into advocating for their beliefs. In 2016, for example, <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/11/students-campaigning-before-elections"><i>The Post</i></a> reported that many students had put campaigning ahead of classes and other duties, making it their number one priority. Students now want to see the change they had anticipated come to fruition.</p>
        
        <p>“While I believe that every single election matters and that every citizen should exercise their civic duty of voting every election cycle, given the current climate of our nation and the important issues at stake, this election is an incredibly important one,” Sloat, who votes in her hometown of Pittsburgh, said. “Our representatives will decide on issues that have direct consequences on the wellbeing and experiences of women, citizens of color, immigrants, people in poverty, LGBT folks and so many more in the United States, and voting this election cycle shows that we care about what happens in our own country.”</p>
