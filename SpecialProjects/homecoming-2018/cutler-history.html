        <p>Cutler Hall, also known as the heart of campus, has been a prominent feature of Ohio University&rsquo;s College Green since it was built in 1816.</p>
<p>Although many students don&rsquo;t know the history behind Cutler Hall, it was built to create more academic space. The dwelling was officially the first college building in the Northwest Territory.</p>
<p>Benjamin Corp, of Marietta, was hired as the building&rsquo;s architect and oversaw the construction of the building. For the job, he was given $6. Once the building was finished, it was dubbed the College Edifice. The total expense of Cutler Hall totaled $17,806 on April 19, 1819. </p>
<p>Cutler Hall was named after Manasseh Cutler, who persuaded the U.S. to set aside two townships as a land grant for the university. </p>
<p>The university continued to grow in size and required an addition. In 1835-1839, the East Wing and West Wing buildings were added. These are known today as McGuffey Hall and Wilson Hall. </p>
<p>Cutler was remodeled in the 1880s when the roof was raised and more classrooms were added to house more students. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1936, Cutler was abandoned as a class site, and only part of it remained occupied by administrative offices. </p>
<p>During the remodeling, Cutler&rsquo;s wooden floors were replaced with concrete, and new windows, doors and elevators were added. Modern heating, lighting and plumbing were also installed.</p>
<p>In 1947, workers also found a pickled hand, apparently an exhibit in the old museum in Cutler&rsquo;s tower, according to a <em>Post</em> report from 1972. </p>
<p>Cutler Hall was rededicated October 18-19, 1947. At the rededication ceremony, the song &ldquo;Old Manasseh Cutler&rdquo; was played. This is when Cutler Hall received its current name.</p>
<p>On Sept. 14, 1820, a resolution was passed for the purchase of a bell for the College Edifice. This bell is still in Cutler, but the bell no longer rings. Today, the chimes are recorded on tapes sent out by loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Cutler&rsquo;s clock was a gift presented by the class of 1914. The clock often does show the incorrect time due to infrequent winding.</p>
<p>In June 1966, Cutler was determined &ldquo;the most historic landmark in Ohio&rdquo; and was declared a National Historic Landmark. A plaque was also unveiled on the steps of Cutler marking it as the oldest university building. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the fact that it&rsquo;s been here since the beginning ,&rdquo; said Tammy Babylon, executive office administer for the vice president of Student Affairs. &ldquo;I am walking in the halls our founding fathers have walked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler Hall is still in use today and has been on campus for 202 years.</p>
