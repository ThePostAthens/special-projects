        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">On July 20, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> director <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/">James Gunn was fired</a> over controversial blog posts made in 2011 containing slurs and descriptions of sex acts. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has not quite been the same since. </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">While Gunn apologized immediately after the post was criticized and has continued to apologize since, Disney decided to fire him because the statements were &ldquo;indefensible and inconsistent with our studio&rsquo;s values.&rdquo;</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">The cast of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> took to Twitter to defend Gunn&rsquo;s morals and character, with Dave Bautista, who portrays Drax, being the most visibly upset. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://twitter.com/davebautista/status/1020502763430559744?lang=en">In a tweet posted the day Gunn was fired</a>, he said, &ldquo;James Gunn is one of the most loving, caring, good natured people I have ever met.&rdquo; This situation has affected Bautista so much that he has even threatened to quit if Gunn&rsquo;s script is not used for Volume 3 of the series, saying he is only continuing to work for Disney because he is legally obligated to do so.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">Gunn&rsquo;s first job in the MCU &mdash; directing <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>in 2014 &mdash; was a big success, despite apprehension from fans about the quality of a movie that had virtually unknown characters. It grossed $773,328,629 worldwide. 2017&rsquo;s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 had an even bigger turnout, grossing $863,756,051 worldwide. </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">Fans became captivated by the stark contrast of the humor and overall plot of the movies compared to the serious tone of previous movies in the MCU. Without Gunn&rsquo;s direction and unmatched wit to make Vol. 3, the best Guardians movie yet, fans are worried that the third installment will fall flat.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">While Disney searches for a new director, the production of Vol. 3 has been put on hold indefinitely. Though Disney has claimed that it will be using Gunn&rsquo;s script for the film, postponing production indefinitely could twist the fate of the <em>Guardians</em> characters involvment in <em>Avengers 4</em>. Rumors have been circulating that Disney <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/08/26/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-replacement-director-taika-waititi-rum/">could hire Taika Waititi</a>, director of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, because of the quirkiness shown in the film that is similar to the previous <em>Guardians</em> films.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">In the aftermath of Gunn&rsquo;s firing, DC&rsquo;s Cinematic Universe took the opportunity to scoop up Gunn for writing and possibly directing the next <em>Suicide Squad</em> film, set for a 2019 release. Since 2016&rsquo;s <em>Suicide Squad</em> received abysmal reviews and didn&rsquo;t do as well at the box office as planned, Gunn&rsquo;s version of <em>Suicide Squad 2</em> may just be the lucky break that the DC Cinematic Universe needs to compete with the MCU. DC may even gain Bautista in the process, who is looking for any reason to get out of his contract with Disney.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin: 0pt -11pt 8pt -11pt;">With Gunn out of the picture in the <em>Guardians</em> films, it raises the question of if <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 </em>will be as successful as the first two or is even made at all. At least now we have a decent DC movie to look forward to.</p>
