        <p>The College Book Store plans to give back to Athens through the Homecoming for the Homeless event during Homecoming weekend.</p>
        
        <p>Exactly ten percent of the College Book Store’s net profits on Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be donated to Good Works, a homeless shelter organization in Athens.</p>
        
        <p>The year marks the tenth anniversary of Homecoming for the Homeless event. Andrew Stout, the associate general manager and one of the managing partners of College Book Store, is the head of this program.</p>
        
           <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/852175d2-391e-49c6-a7bc-b0cf77e46462.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Meagan HAll | DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY</p><p class="pcut">College Bookstore is located at the corner of Court Street and Union Street at 55 South Court Street.</p> </div>
        
        <p>Stout said Homecoming for the Homeless was created to allow the College Book Store to do more philanthropy.</p>
        
        <p>“As a local company, based right here in Athens, Ohio, we think it’s really important to give back to the community you serve,” Stout said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>The event is a way to remind people that the College Book Store is a local business that wants to give back to the community.</p>
        
        <p>“One of the reasons people like to support a local business is the sense that generally more of their dollars spent get returned back to the community,” Stout said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>Stout said Homecoming for the Homeless is one of three main events the College Bookstore does throughout the academic year. During Siblings Weekend, the College Book Store supports the local chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters by selling shirts. Shirts are also sold during Moms Weekend to support My Sister’s Place, a domestic violence agency in Athens.</p>
        
        <p>Lauren Bennett, a sophomore studying environmental geography, said she thinks the event is a good way the bookstore is giving back to the community.</p>
        
        <p>“I think (Homecoming for the Homeless) is a good idea because I think there’s a lot of poor income families and homeless around here,” Bennett said. “And I think they could use the help.”</p>
        
        <p>Mia McDulin, a freshman studying chemistry, said she thinks a lot of people go to the bookstore to get OU gear, especially during weekends like Homecoming and Halloween.</p>
        
        <p>“It’s more hometown based, taking care of those around you,” McDulin said.</p>
        
        <p>Stout said the College Book Store will be pass out Homecoming for the Homeless balloons before the parade to promote the event and school spirit while lining the streets with green balloons.</p>
