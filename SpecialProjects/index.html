        <h1>Special Projects Page</h1>
        <p>In the fall of 2016, The Post gained the ability to code and host thier own special projects on a subdomain of ThePostAthens.com. To take full advantage of this, a staff of four experienced writers were assembled. The "senior writers" as they were known, reported to the executive editors, and worked closely with the web, photo and design staffs to fully realize their stories. The stories below are the product of a lot of hard work, by an amazing team of people.</p>
