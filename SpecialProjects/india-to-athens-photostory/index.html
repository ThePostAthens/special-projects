        <p><strong><em>Clarification: A photo below has been updated to better explain the photo.</em></strong></p>

        <p>Nagesh Rao, 54, and Saumya Pant, 42, met at Ohio University in 1998. At the time, Rao was an interpersonal communication professor, and Pant was working toward a doctorate in communication studies.</p>

        <p>Rao, from southern India, and Pant, from northern India, faced disapproval from their parents while dating due to the age gap of almost 13 years and their cultural differences.</p>

        <p>Rao and Pant dated for four years before having a traditional Indian wedding in a Hindu temple in Chicago, though they still lived in Athens.</p>

Someone from a higher caste would never share germs with an untouchable, so tasting from a community dish like this is still looked down upon at most Indians gatherings, especially where elders are present. However, it has become a personal preference that is not an issue for most families. There is no equivalent English word for jhoota.</p>

        <p>Their daughters are Paavni, 12, and Suhanni, 10.</p>

        <p>The family has lived in Abu Dhabi, India, New Mexico and Athens. Rao and Pant hope Paavni and Suhaani will be able to live in any type of environment.</p>

        </div>

        <p>They left Abu Dhabi, where they lived in 2005, because they found few research opportunities and disagreed with the restrictions on women’s freedoms.</p>

        <p>“Empowerment is not just about rubbing shoulders with men and working with men; it’s about what kind of dignity and self-respect you live your life, what agency you have in life, the capacity to make changes and influence change,” Pant said about the women she taught. “These women have found ways to feel empowered and independent in their domestic spaces.”</p>

        <p>Both Rao and Pant taught a racially diverse population of students at the University of New Mexico in 2008.</p>

        <p>After Rao’s mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2009, the family moved to India in 2010. While there, Rao served as president of MICA University. During his time as president, monkeys often camped outside their windows and peered into their home for entertainment.</p>

        <p>Having returned to Athens in 2016 in search of better employment, Pant holds a one-year teaching position at Ohio University, and Rao is a consultant for the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine.</p>

        <p>“I look different from all of you … Are you curious about the dot I wear or the clothes I wear?” Pant said to her students. “It’s perfectly OK to not know, but it’s also OK for you to ask me rather than (be) uncomfortable around me the whole term.”</p>

On Nov. 4, 2016 she lectured on hijras, male-to-female transgender individuals living mostly in India and Pakistan. At the end of class, she showed a video demonstrating their persecution and how people hire them for all the main holidays and celebrations yet discriminate against them the rest of the time.</p>
