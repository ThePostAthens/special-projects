        <p>Nagesh Rao, 54, and Saumya Pant, 42, met at Ohio University in 1998. At the time, Rao was a interpersonal communication professor, and Pant was working toward a doctorate in communication studies.</p>
        
        <p>Rao, from southern India, and Pant, from northern India, faced disapproval from their parents while dating due to the age gap of almost 13 years and their cultural differences.</p>
        
        <p>Rao and Pant dated for four years before having a traditional Indian wedding in a Hindu temple in Chicago, though they still lived in Athens.</p>

                <p class="galleryPcut">Husband and father, Nagesh Rao, jokingly places a red Christmas ribbon on his sweatshirt while he pulls Christmas decorations out of shopping bags with his daughter, Paavni, in their Athens home on Dec. 6, 2016. They plan to only be back in Athens for a year as they hope to start an organization for empowering women, called “Siya,” after an Indian god who is a powerful woman known for sacrifice.</p>

                <p class="galleryPcut">Chicken Curry, Dal, Pulao, Okra and Saag Paneer are conventional North Indian dishes that the Pant-Rao family enjoy. South Indians traditionally use more mustard seed in simpler dishes, while North Indians cook lavish meals with a lot of cumin.</p>

                <p class="galleryPcut">Saumya "jhootas" the spoon while adding spices to one of her Indian dishes on Nov. 21, 2016. The concept of jhoota originates from the caste system. Someone from a higher caste would never share germs with an untouchable, so tasting from a community dish like this is still looked down upon at most Indians gatherings, especially where elders are present. However, it has become a personal preference that is not an issue for most families. There is no equivalent English word for jhoota.</p>

                <p class="pcut">"It was pretty good! I really liked it," Suhaani said after eating a Rice Krispy Treat for her first time at her elementary school on Nov. 15, 2016.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>They left Abu Dhabi, where they lived in 2005, because they found few research opportunities and disagreed with the restrictions on women’s freedoms.</p>
        
        <p>“Empowerment is not just about rubbing shoulders with men and working with men; it’s about what kind of dignity and self-respect you live your life, what agency you have in life, the capacity to make changes and influence change,” Pant said about the women she taught. “These women have found ways to feel empowered and independent in their domestic spaces.”</p>
        
        <p>Both Rao and Pant taught a racially diverse population of students at the University of New Mexico in 2008.</p>
        
        <p>After Rao’s mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2009, the family moved to India in 2010. While there, Rao served as president of MICA University. During his time as president, monkeys often camped outside their windows and peered into their home for entertainment.</p>
        
        <p>Having returned to Athens in 2016 in search of better employment, Pant holds a one-year teaching position at Ohio University, and Rao is a consultant for the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine.</p>
        
        <p>“I look different from all of you … Are you curious about the dot I wear or the clothes I wear?” Pant said to her students. “It’s perfectly OK to not know, but it’s also OK for you to ask me rather than (be) uncomfortable around me the whole term.”</p>
