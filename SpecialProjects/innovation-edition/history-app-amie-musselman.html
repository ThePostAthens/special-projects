            <p>While some teachers restrict phone usage in the classroom, Amie Musselman encourages it in the form of a history app she developed for students.</p>

            <p>Musselman, a junior studying middle childhood education, created the app &ldquo;D-Day&rdquo; through a web-development site &ldquo;<a href="https://arisgames.org">Aris</a>&rdquo; in an attempt to educate students about the historical raid of the Normandy beaches in a unique way. The &ldquo;D-Day&rdquo; app is available to download through the Aris app, which is free to download on the App Store. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;(D-Day is) a historical narrative that emphasizes player choice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The gamer gets a persona of Jack Clippinger, which is a soldier on the first wave over to France. &hellip; Depending on your choices, you either die or survive D-Day.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>There are nine outcomes of the game, three of which result in the player surviving and winning the game and one of which allows the player to receive a purple heart.</p>

            <p>The game starts with a YouTube video of U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower&rsquo;s speech over footage of D-Day. The player must then select where they are going.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;You have to know where it occurred and place it on the map,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can talk about D-Day and some people don&rsquo;t know where that happened. You have to know it&rsquo;s in France.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The player is then offered an array of choices to consider in a war scenario. The game also allows the player to interact with real historical figures, including President Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s son, who was a key figure during the invasion of the Normandy beaches. </p>

            <p>If the player does not survive, the game will loop to the beginning and they can try again. If they succeed, the game ends with a clip of footage from World War II.</p>

            <p>Musselman first created the app with a partner her freshman year as part of a class to incorporate education into mobile media. She hasn&rsquo;t changed the content, but has made &ldquo;minor tweaks&rdquo; to the game.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;History usually isn&rsquo;t the favorite,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People groan and grudge at the idea of history, like &lsquo;How does it affect me today?&rsquo; That was my goal: to use a modern mode of technology to then teach history. While this is not a full invasion of Normandy lesson, it could augment it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>As part of her education in the Patton College of Education&rsquo;s honors program, Musselman is required to develop a thesis and conduct a research project. In February, she went to a high school to conduct her research study in an American history class. </p>

            <p>Prior to her arrival, the teacher gave the students a lesson on D-Day. Musselman collected data from 87 students utilizing a pre-survey and then had students play her game. Following the game, she had students take a post-survey. She said about 10 or 15 more participants said the app improved their enjoyment of social studies.</p>

            <p>Musselman said teachers&rsquo; backlash is not realistic and rather than banning technology, they should embrace it.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;At school, if they&rsquo;re not being used, the students will go home and use it for hours on end,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disconnect. To bridge that gap, we can use it as a tool.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>She said technology is integral to teaching in a modern-era and she hopes her app will help students become passionate about history and learning.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this stigma with using phones and or tablets in the classroom because it can be a distraction,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you monitor it well, it could be useful. &hellip; The whole goal of history is to acknowledge what happened so those mistakes don&rsquo;t happen again or to continue on what&rsquo;s working.&rdquo;</p>
