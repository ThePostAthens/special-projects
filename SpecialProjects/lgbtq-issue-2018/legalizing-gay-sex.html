        <p>In a historically unanimous ruling, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code; which has been used for more than 150 years to harass, assault, blackmail and incarcerate people who are LGBTQ in India, was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-verdict-on-section-377-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/65695884.cms">repealed</a> on Sept. 6, 2018 by a five-judge panel, according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/world/asia/gay-in-india-where-progress-has-come-only-with-risk.html">New York Times article.</a></p>
        
        <p>Anjali Gopalan has played a key role in repealing Section 377 in India, which <a href="https://search-proquest-com.proxy.library.ohio.edu/usnews/docview/2048878175/DF2DF42D60E94C17PQ/3?accountid=12954">legally imprisoned people</a> who engaged in same-sex intercourse.</p>
        
        <p>She fights for LGBTQ rights in India and brought change with the help of other activists after she filed a Public Interest Litigation in 2001 against Section 377, according to the Naz Foundation (India) Trust website. Gopalan, founder and executive director of the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, a non-governmental organization, has been creating awareness for HIV/AIDS since the 1990s, along with fighting for equal treatment of LGBTQ society in India, according to the <a href="http://nazindia.org/story-of-naz/">Naz Foundation (India) Trust website</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In Section 377 of the <a href="http://ncw.nic.in/acts/theindianpenalcode1860.pdf">Indian Penal Code</a> same-sex is described as an “unnatural offense” and states: “Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. The explanation: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.”</p>
        
        <p>The law was amended in 2009 as well, but due to appeals filed by various religious groups, same-sex intercourse was criminalized again.</p>
        
        <p>It has now been amended again, so that people who identify as LGBTQ can now have same-sex intercourse without facing fear of prosecution.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_left"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/3f19528d-fd3b-49aa-9f88-dcd326384e4e.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Marcus Pavilonis | ILLUSTRATION</p><p class="pcut">image description here</p> </div>
        
        <p>Vernil Verma, a graduate student from India studying information and telecommunications, said he finds this new freedom necessary because people should have the right to be whoever they want to be.</p>
        
        <p>Verma is frustrated that India is late in amending its laws because of the rigid traditional and religious ideologies, which influence politics.</p>
        
        <p>“I think we’re getting there,” Verma said. “I think it’s going to take time.”</p>
        
        <p>He said he believes people who identify as LGBTQ deserve to have a family and adopt children.</p>
        
        <p>He hopes the amendment lasts for at least 5 to 6 years. He is concerned the amendments won’t last long as it was already approved in 2009 and then disapproved again in 2013.</p>
        
        <p>“I hope it doesn’t,” Verman said.</p>
        
        <p>Parul Jain, an assistant professor at the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism, said the public opinion was one of the factors that helped the law to get approved and disapproved again.</p>
        
        <p>Jain, like Verma, hopes that people who identify as LGBTQ are able to get married. </p>
        
        <p>“This should have been allowed all along,” she said. “There’s always hope.”</p>
        
        <p>Jain said people who are LGBTQ should, now, not be afraid to display their affection publicly, but there is still stigma attached to it because a lot of variables are attached to it such as personality and region.</p>
        
        <p>Madhav Madan, a senior studying sports management from India, finds the change positive as all people should have the right to do whatever they want.</p>
        
        <p>He, however, is disappointed that the change came so late because of India’s position as a developing, democratic country. He said the main reason for the delay in the law change is because of the high generation gap. Youths are more likely to create change in the society, Madan said.</p>
        
        <p>“Young people are the most important for the country’s future,” Madan said. “We need to raise our voices as much as we can.”</p>
        
        <p>Madan said he wishes LGBTQ people could be married legally and that the change in law is the first step towards freedom in choice.</p>
        
        <p>“This is a really big step,” Madan said.</p>
