        <p>The LGBTQ community at Ohio University has been working to change the stigma surrounding offensive terms, and students are taking a stance and reclaiming these words as their own.</p>
        
        <p>We see some of the first positive uses of the word in the ‘80s when organizations began using gay and queer as part of their title, said Dr. Amy White, an executive director of The Southeastern Ohio Rainbow Alliance.</p>
        
        <p>Reclaiming these sometimes offensive words can be a form of empowerment, but they also recognize that sometimes it is only appropriate in certain spaces, said delfin bautista, director of the LGBT Center, who uses they/them pronouns and the lowercase spelling of their name.</p>
        
        <p>The number one controversy is who can use these reclaimed words, because there is a need for a safe space, bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>“(It’s) kind of a point of pride,” said Ariel Keener, a freshman studying sociology. “(They’re) just labels at the end of the day.”</p>
        
        <p>It is common for members of the LGBTQ community to refer to themselves as queer. bautista lists themself as queer in their professional description as a staff member at the university.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/8b5037d2-1666-4f79-8b4e-eb552c2d6894.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Marcus Pavilonis | ILLUSTRATION</p> </div>
        
        <p>By reclaiming the word queer, for example, the LGBTQ community is hoping to redefine it as something more empowering and less degrading. The definition of queer is differing in some odd way from what is usual or normal, according to Merriam Webster. This definition, however, is often taken out of context.</p>
        
        <p>“It gives (the LGBTQ community) some of the control over the narrative surrounding them,” White said.</p>
        
        <p>Kylee Clark, a freshman studying communications and public advocacy, said she thinks it is important for individuals of the LGBTQ community to reclaim words because negative connotations can later be used as empowerment.</p>
        
        <p>“They’re taking the insult and using it to make themselves feel better, or think highly of themselves,” Clark said.</p>
        
        <p>She also says that if she were talking about empowerment, or something along those lines, she may feel comfortable using these words as an ally with members of the community.</p>
        
        <p>In order to create a safe space individuals should be mindful of context and safety, bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>A safe space is defined as a place (as on a college campus) intended to be free of bias, conflict, criticism, or potentially threatening actions, ideas, or conversations, according to Merriam Webster.</p>
        
        <p>The LGBT Center located in Baker Student Center is one place considered to be a safe space.</p>
        
        <p>The university also offers a program called <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/safezone.cfm">Safezone</a>, which is a training program designed to raise awareness about different areas regarding gender and sexuality.</p>
        
        <p>Reclaiming offensive words and phrases acts as an opportunity to form a community and spark allies, bautista said. These words will continue to be a conversation within the community.</p>
        
        <p>There really isn’t one standard reaction, White said. Reaction depends on the word being used, how it’s being used and the person involved.</p>
        
        <p>“For some it could still be considered derogatory and hurtful, although it’s becoming less and less,” White said, “I can identify and I do identify as queer, but I would not say that persons queer unless I knew that person was comfortable with that identification.”</p>
        
        <p>White also talked about the usefulness of the word queer and how it can encompass all of the LGBTQ community without having to say the long title.</p>
        
        <p>According to bautista, their dearly beloved doesn’t like the term queer, but this doesn’t stop bautista from identifying themselves this way.</p>
        
        <p>“We’re here, we’re queer, we’ve always been here,” bautista said.</p>
