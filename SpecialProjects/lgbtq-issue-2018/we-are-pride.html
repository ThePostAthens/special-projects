        <p>Many thanks to <i>The Post</i> for creating this rainbowlicious edition and for ongoing support throughout the year.</p>
        
        <p>I am often asked if being “a LGBT” is a choice? Many have responded to this question with, “Why would anyone choose this life?” or  “Why would anyone choose the hardship?” or “Why would anyone choose to be discriminated?” Most recently, however, I’ve decided to rant to the world, “Why NOT choose being queer?!?!” I am not ashamed, and there is nothing wrong or “less than” for being me, or being you, or being us.  We need to take pride in our is-ness and should not, cannot, will not feel shame or have folks throw misguided shade.</p>
        
        <p>I honestly don’t think LGBT identities are choices. However, if I could choose, I would choose queer every day. This is not to undermine the experiences of hardship that many, myself included, have experienced: discrimination, rejection, isolation, violence and confusion. But I also have done some incredible things like engaging different universities in faith-grounded conversations regarding inclusion of LGBTQ students, getting to hang out with folks who teach me every day about beingness, and getting to join my voice with the countless others advocating for “all are welcome” to truly mean “all are welcome” at Ohio University and beyond. Also, it’s fun being the person who “scares inclusivity” into people on and off campus.</p>
        
        <p>I don’t want us to feel bad about ourselves or for others to take pity — no to the pity!  I want people to be proud of us and for all of us to pridefully chant:  “We are here, we are queer and we aren’t going anywhere!” </p>
        
        <p>It is an exciting moment to live into pride at OU — we are celebrating the LGBT Center’s 20th rainbowversary.  At the same time, this pride is not at the expense of raising awareness about the challenges and tragedies we have endured and continue to endure as a community.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The murders of transgender people, especially trans women of color, in the U.S. and around the world that go unreported and unnoticed.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The microaggressions that students experience everyday in the classroom and other spaces on Athens campus and all OU campuses.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The reality that, yes, we can get married, but we can also be fired in 30 states and executed in 7 countries.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• Folks in our community who are targeted with sexual violence and other forms of violence for being LGBT with little or no recourse from our community.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The whitewashing, ciswashing and heterowashing of the radicalness of LGBTQ folks, our contributions, and our stories.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The kids who are kicked out of their homes for living and loving beyond the norm.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The countless and often unknown victims of sexualized violence who identify as trans, gender variant or queer.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• Just a month ago, a 9-year-old gay boy committed suicide in Colorado.</p>
        
        <p>Claiming and reclaiming that we are pride is a re-energizer to continue to counter the violence and silencing of queer lives. We are pride, and we honor with pride:</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, Miss Major and all those who refused to be bullied and silenced at Stone Wall.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• The repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell in 2010.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• June 26, 2015, when marriage equality became the law of the land.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• We are living at a time where there are more and more out political candidates running for office and being elected into office.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• In 2017, the City of Athens banned conversion therapy on minors.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">• In June, we had our first Pride Parade as a community.</p>
        
        <p>OU has and is and will be taking steps to fully live into diversity and inclusion. We have an LGBT Center, gender-neutral housing, the LGBTQ Studies Certificate, a name and pronoun policy, trans healthcare for students and employees and the LGBT Living Experience. Also, we are creating more gender-inclusive restrooms.</p>
        
        <p>We reflect and we remember our heroes, sheroes and *insert-gender-neutral-pronoun*-roes: Gloria Anzaldua, Albus Dumbledore, Bayard Rustin, Ellen Page, Frank Ocean, Carmen Carrera, Langston Hughes, Harvey Milk, Alice Walker, Neil Patrick Harris, Zachary Quinto, RuPaul, Tom Daley, Laverne Cox, Audre Lorde and Margaret Cho. They are trailblazers past and present, who spark and rekindle our commitment to embodying #bobcatrainbowwarriorfierceness.</p>
        
        <p>We are pride! All of us, without exception, are fabulous, fierce, glittery, amazing and unicornlicious!  We are pride, we are here, we are queer, we have always been here and we will always be here. Cheers and queers!</p>
