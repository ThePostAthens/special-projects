            <p>Emily Wolfe got her first experience teaching in a classroom at The Plains Elementary during her junior year at Ohio University. Now she in her first year of graduate school at OU, and she is back teaching at The Plains. </p>
<p>The Patton College of Education&rsquo;s curriculum requires all students to work alongside teachers in area school districts, Marcy Keifer Kennedy, OU&rsquo;s director of the Center for Professional Development School Partnerships, said. </p>
<p>"It really helped me personally, I was more confident about wanting to be a teacher because a lot of college students that first go in, they might not know what they want to do and they're trying to decide,&rdquo; Wolfe said.</p>
<p>She teaches math, sciences and social studies to first graders at The Plains, and was a part of the Center during her undergraduate years. She taught at Morrison Gordon elementary her senior year. </p>
<p>Ohio University President Roderick McDavis was the dean of two colleges of education, a professor of education and counselor education and a vice president for academic affairs before becoming OU&rsquo;s president. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He pledged he would <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2014/10/reviewing-rod-president-mcdavis-pledged-to-improve-local-schools-in-2004">improve local schools</a> during his presidency. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If our work is education, then that work must be applied to actively improving the quality of public schools throughout Southeast Ohio,&rdquo; McDavis said in his inaugural address in 2004. </p>
            
             <blockquote class="pq_right">
            “&ldquo;We must never forget that a better educated populace leads to a better workforce for tomorrow&rsquo;s jobs.&rdquo;” 
            
            <span class="attribution">President Roderick McDavis</span>
            
            </blockquote>
            
<p>During McDavis&rsquo; time at OU, Athens City Schools have seen an increase in student test results with the exception of 2014-2015, according to the performance index annually distributed by the Ohio Department of Education.</p>
<p>The Center for Professional Development School Partnerships partners with Alexander Local Schools, Athens City Schools, Federal Hocking Schools, Logan Hocking Schools, Nelsonville-York City Schools, Trimble Local Schools and Southern Local and Perry County, Kennedy said. </p>
<p>The main mission of the Center is to positively impact students in preschool through grade 12, and the Center has been appreciative of the support McDavis during his presidency, Kennedy said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I've seen, candidates really feel as if they are educating the children of that building,&rdquo; Kennedy said. &ldquo;They're not just stopping in for a couple hours to teach a lesson. &hellip; There part of those environments, they're part of those children's lives.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Liz Hoisington teaches English and Language Arts to first graders at The Plains, and said she thinks the partnership is fantastic. Together, she works with Wolfe to teach first grade. </p>
<p>"We get strong candidates &hellip;. and our faculty all work really close together and &nbsp;we feel very heard by the university,&rdquo; Hoisington said. </p>
<p>She said the teachers are included in the planning meetings. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it as a true partnership where we are working with the university, but the university is always working with us,&rdquo; Hoisington said. </p>
<p>Hoisington said she can not imagine being at a college that did not have a partnership with local schools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't imagine as a college student, being at a university that did not have a partnership with the schools." </p>
