        <h4  id="byline"><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/mayganbeeler">Maygan Beeler</a> /</strong> <span class="title">For The Post</span></h4>
            
           
        <p>When a university president resigns, the transition that follows isn&rsquo;t always a smooth one. </p>

        <p>Tension at Ohio University peaked in 1974 when concerns over a dwindling university budget, low enrollment and turbulent national politics erupted into campus riots. Former university President Claude Sowle resigned from his position largely as a result of those demonstrations. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Sowle was a president who faced crises with a deliberate calm and a calculating precision. But as the economic base of the University crumbled, so did Sowle,&rdquo; read a column titled &ldquo;Why it happened&rdquo; that appeared in a May 1974 edition of The Post. </p>

        <p>More than 40 years later, OU President Roderick McDavis&rsquo; final weeks in office were also marked by displays of discontent. <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/02/police-detain-70-baker">A sit-in,</a> a <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/02/fundraiser-detained-protestors">&ldquo;sing-in&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/02/protest-trump-baker-center">a rally</a> against U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s immigration ban were organized as McDavis planned to leave the university following his resignation <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/03/president-roderick-mcdavis-announces-hell-step-down-when-contract-expires-in-2017">announced last spring.</a></p>

        <p>On Feb. 7, McDavis sent a university-wide email to cancel his <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/02/presidential-farewell-event-canceled">farewell open house</a> due to a possible protest scheduled to occur at the same time and place as the open house. </p>

        <p>McDavis wrote that he and his wife &ldquo;have concerns for our OUPD officers and want to avoid unnecessary run-ins between OUPD officers and protesters who feel they have legitimate issues and concerns.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Though Sowle&rsquo;s farewell party passed without incident, he sometimes had a difficult relationship with protest groups. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;President Claude R. Sowle yesterday indicated he thought the demonstration was a waste of time,&rdquo; a 1974 Post article said of his reaction to a multi-issue rally. &ldquo;He said the demonstrator&rsquo;s actions were legal, but added they &lsquo;have the right to make damn fools of themselves if they wish.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

        <p>Sowle briefly reconsidered resigning but eventually reaffirmed his original decision. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;A man whose students riot, allegedly &lsquo;physically assault&rsquo; him, demand his resignation and threaten to kidnap a member of his family all in one week might be considered a prime candidate for resignation, at least emotionally,&rdquo; 1974 Post editor P.J. Bednarski wrote in a story titled &ldquo;Sowle&rsquo;s eight days in May: &lsquo;insanity,&rsquo; support, indecision.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Though all of the things Bednarski mentioned did occur and influence Sowle&rsquo;s decision, several groups including Administrative Senate, Faculty Senate and Graduate Student Council asked him to stay. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Some think Sowle was bad, most agree somebody else could have been a lot worse,&rdquo; <em>The Post</em> explained in an article summarizing his farewell party. </p>

        <p>Just as David Descutner will become OU&rsquo;s interim president Feb. 18, former OU President Harry Crewson assumed his interim role after Sowle&rsquo;s departure. </p>

        <p>OU archivist Bill Kimok remembers Crewson as a friend, popular in the university community and responsible for bringing the osteopathic medical college to campus. </p>

        <p>Not everyone shared that sentiment, however. As evidenced by a letter to the editor of <em>The Post</em> titled &ldquo;Turn Crewson loose,&rdquo; some thought he wasn&rsquo;t accomplishing enough. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;In many ways I am in an awkward situation,&rdquo; Crewson told <em>The Post</em> in 1975. &ldquo;Some things that possibly should be moving I am holding in limbo until the announcement (of the new president) is made.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>After a year of searching, the 13-member OU Presidential Search Committee selected Charles Ping, a former Presbyterian minister, philosophy professor and football coach to replace Crewson. </p>

        <p>Sowle gave Crewson a two-month orientation, though Crewson warned future university presidents that no introduction to the job could be sufficient. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I think there is no way to understand the responsibility and demands of the position until you take over,&rdquo; Crewson said.</p>
            
        <p><strong>Correction: A previous version of this report incorrectly spelled P.J. Bednarski's name. The article has been updated with the most accurate information.</strong></p>
