    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
    <p class="intro">
        <span>A</span>ll mediums of art have the opportunity to leave a lasting impact on its observers. Artists take their inspiration from how the world looks around them presently and how it looked in the past. Sometimes, how the artwork looks when it's finished can remind people that certain past social and cultural issues have only been modernized to fit the present.

<p>Kimberly Chapman is a porcelain sculptor from Cleveland who said her work centers on what women have faced and continue to endure due to misogyny that stems from patriarchal societies. Chapman's newest collection reveals misogyny's role in the admittance of women to the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, West Virginia, during the late 19th century and 20th century. Chapman's work is titled Eighty-Six Reasons after the asylum's "Reasons for Admittance", which detailed what was believed to be pre-conditions of mental illnesses. </p>

<p>Chapman spent about six months researching before she started making any sculptures and kept digging deeper and deeper into the history of asylums. </p>

<p>"Reading a novel could send you to a lunatic asylum," Chapman said. "Menstrual problems, mastubration was on there. Grief. I mean, it was so crazy."</p>

<p>Some of the other reasons women could be admitted to the asylum were listed as "ill treatment by husband," "jealousy and religion," "asthma," "death of sons in war," "women trouble," "laziness" and more.</p>

<p>It was also easy for men to send their wives to asylums if they believed their wives weren't fitting in with societal standards, Chapman said. She added men only needed two doctor's signatures to admit their wives.</p>

<p>Eighty-Six Reasons found a perfect home for one of its showings: The Dairy Barn Arts Center. The Dairy Barn is a space for educational art purposes and for artists to showcase their work. Holly Ittel, the quilt national and exhibitions director for The Dairy Barn, said it was important for Chapman to have her collection in a place relevant to its message. The Athens Lunatic Asylum, currently known as The Ridges, and The Dairy Barn have an important connection.</p>

<p>"When The Ridges was operating as the asylum, a lot of the patients would come down to the dairy barn facility and work and operate the dairy farm here," Ittel said. "So The Dairy Barn was at the time that it was built and operating as a dairy farm was part of The Ridges' complex."</p>

<p>Although Chapman's art was inspired by the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, it carries a reminder of The Ridges and its troubled past. </p>

<p>"The whole purpose of the art being a teaching collection is to teach people what women have endured historically, so that they can see today where that all came from," Chapman said. "They'll be able to draw parallels still to what's happening in society today, but only by understanding what has happened in the past and these different vignettes that I shine a light on."</p>

<P>All of Chapman's sculptures and work in the collection have layers to their meanings and are up for different interpretations. Possibly one of her favorite pieces from the collection is "The Gold Masked Women." These were the first three sculptures that Chapman made and they depict women wearing gold face coverings in straight jackets.</P>

<P>"The idea (is) that the masks are obstructing vision, thought and speech," Chapman said. "Regardless of what they went into these asylums with, whatever struggles they had, once (asylums) became so overcrowded, the living conditions were so unbearable that these things would be masked anyhow, just from being there."</P>

<p>The collection includes over 30 porcelain sculptures and oversized tintype photography where Chapman poses as an asylum patient in historical clothing. People can see Chapman's collection in-person at The Dairy Barn, 8000 Dairy Lane, from May 28 to Sept. 4. At The Dairy Barn, admission costs $7 for the general fee, $5 for students and is free for members of the art center, Ittel said.</p>

<P>Chapman's other work and more can be found on her <a href="https://www.kimberlychapmansculptor.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. Her art explores subjects of deep depth with the purpose of teaching.</P>

<P>"That's the purpose in my own small way, to teach people about what women have endured in the past and to think about it and to think about where we are today," Chapman said. "And to reflect on their personal experience with themselves and their families and their friends and take away some kernels of learning that hadn't maybe occurred to them before.</P>
