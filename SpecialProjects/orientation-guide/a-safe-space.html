         <p>What is the difference between gender expression and gender identity? What&rsquo;s next in the struggle for LGBTQ+ equality? What order do the letters go in in the acronym, and what about the I, Q, P, A and others? What is the difference between &ldquo;ally&rdquo; and &ldquo;accomplice&rsquo;? Which places on Court Street are welcoming of queer folk? What resources are available on and off campus? Why is it necessary to have the &ldquo;Query A Queer&rdquo; column? </p>
<p>Before we get to the questions above, I would like to first welcome you to Ohio University. We are excited that you are here and look forward to how your Bobcat journey will evolve. The LGBT Center is resource to all Bobcats. If you need a place to study, to connect with others, need help with an assignment, have questions about coming out, are looking for a place to nap or want to get involved in queer antics on and off campus &mdash; we are yOUr center. </p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_left"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/16988_lgbtcentersf.jpg" alt="LGBT Centers" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Hannah Ruhoff | FILE</p><p class="pcut">delfin bautista, the director of the LGBT center, sits in their office at Ohio University's LGBT Center on Monday.</p> </div>
        
        
<p>The LGBT Center advocates for safer spaces on campus for LGBTQ+ individuals, works with faculty to incorporate queer scholarship in the classroom, offers the physical space of the center itself, collaborates with campus partners on programs such as speakers and film and is a bridge to resources on and off campus for the LGBTQ+ community in Southeastern Ohio. </p>
<p>Understanding the ever-changing and evolving worlds of sexuality and gender can be overwhelming and confusing. The LGBT Center is committed to creating spaces on and off campus for conversations on sexual and gender diversities; our goal is to explain why &ldquo;it&rsquo;s complicated&rdquo; is the best answer we can give because it truly is complicated (and queertastically awesome!). &nbsp;Oftentimes the questions that people ask us lead to more questions rather than specific answers. I have come to realize that many people want a &ldquo;1+1=2&rdquo; situation when it comes to their questions about LGBT people, identities and issues; however, the reality is that sexuality and gender are not linear, are not always predictable and are as dynamic as they are confusing.</p>
<p>At the center, we are mindful that the world of sexuality, gender and queerness is constantly evolving. We recognize that identity is a messy place, but we also celebrate the dynamic conversations the confusion sparks. &nbsp;For instance, words like &ldquo;dyke&rdquo; and &ldquo;queer&rdquo; have been reclaimed by some within the community as terms of empowerment, redefining their historically negative meanings. We can get married in all 50 states but can still be fired in over 30 states for identifying as, or being perceived as, LGBTQA. &nbsp;We are now starting to explore the nuances and spectrums of sexual orientation thanks to the affirmation of Asexual and Aromantic identities and experiences, which historically were neglected and overlooked. It&rsquo;s exciting to see the attention that Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox are receiving and how this is pushing society to understand the differences between sexual identity, gender identity and gender expression. At the same time, however, it also overshadows the realities of violence and discrimination experienced by trans people, especially trans women of color. &nbsp;This is just scratching the surface of sexual and gender diversity; to complicate things further, at the center we explore how sexuality and gender intersect with other aspects of identity, such as race, religion, ethnicity, ability, sex, geographic location and more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Query A Queer was created as one way of addressing people&rsquo;s questions and curiosities about all the colors of the rainbow and beyond. The goal is to answer any and all questions. This is your time to ask whatever it is you would like to know or better understand and have never had an opportunity to ask. We challenge you to not hold back; we will not take offense to any questions posed to us. All questions are welcome &mdash; truly no question will go unanswered. Questions and responses will be shared anonymously through <em>The Post</em> and the LGBT Center&rsquo;s social media platforms. We want this to be a space for all and welcome your questions, curiosities and queries, whether you are a student, faculty member, staff member, alumnus or community member.</p>
<p>Send your questions via email to <a href="mailto:lgbt@ohio.edu" style="color: #f4801f">lgbt@ohio.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:oulgbtcenter@gmail.com" style="color: #f4801f">oulgbtcenter@gmail.com</a>, via Tumblr (oulgbtcenter), via Twitter to @oulgbtcenter with hashtag #qaqueer, or post or message on Facebook (oulgbtcenter). &nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring it on, do it to it and query a queer. &nbsp;</p>
