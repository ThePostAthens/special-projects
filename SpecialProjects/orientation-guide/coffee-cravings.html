        <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether sipping on coffee or energy drinks, Ohio University students find one way or another to get their caffeine fix to help stay awake during morning classes. </p>
        <p>Choosing where to purchase coffee Uptown is not only a matter of figuring out which coffee shop has the most cost-effective drinks, it also depends on the location of the cafe in relation to class buildings.</p>
        <p>Those coming from West Union Street, Bromley Hall or heading toward Schoonover Center are closest to Whit&rsquo;s Frozen Custard and Coffee House, 49 S. Court. Those who go to Whit&rsquo;s with any sized thermos can have it filled with light, medium or dark roast coffee for $1.</p>
        <p>Besides coffee, Whit&rsquo;s also offers vanilla and chocolate custard with a variety of toppings that can be added.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a hybrid coffee shop. We&rsquo;re not just coffee, we also offer frozen custard and other kinds of delicious treats,&rdquo; Jason Miller, the general manager of Whit&rsquo;s, said.</p>
        <p>Whit&rsquo;s specialty drink is the &ldquo;affogato&rdquo; which is a scoop of vanilla custard in a shot of hot espresso. Whether a customer chooses to add chocolate drizzle or not, an affogato costs $3.</p>
        <p>Those traveling up Court Street toward Bentley Hall or Copeland Hall are closest to Court Street Coffee, 67 S. Court. A small light or medium roast from Court Street Coffee costs $1.75. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Each month, they offer a different specialty drink<strong>.</strong></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our specialty drinks vary from fruity ones to chocolatey ones,&rdquo; Jake Braden, a barista at Court Street Coffee, said.</p>
        <p>Specialty drinks at Court Street Coffee range from $3.90 to $4.50 for a 16 ounce drink. The price depends on whether a customer wants his or her drink made hot or cold.</p>
        <p>Braden said the close bond of the baristas behind the counter and the energy that bond creates is what sets the cafe apart from others.</p>
        <p>A little farther up Court Street is Brenen&rsquo;s Coffee Cafe, 38 S. Court. For $2, students can get a small cup of coffee filled with one of the many varieties of roasts the cafe offers. Also applies to a regular cup of coffee. Aside from traditional light, medium and dark roasts, Brenen&rsquo;s also offers an organic Costa Rican blend as well as a Highland Grogg blend.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think we have, in my opinion, way more space and way more seating for studying,&rdquo; Josh Thomas, Brenen&rsquo;s owner and OU alumnus, said. &ldquo;Our service is pretty fast. We&rsquo;re efficient for getting people out of here on time. Those two things really set us apart.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The specialty drink offered at Brenen&rsquo;s changes every month. The price of a specialty drink can vary from $3.75 to $4.75. </p>
        <p>Those coming to campus from Washington Street can make a quick stop at Donkey Coffee and Espresso, 17 W. Washington. A small cup of light, medium or dark fair-trade certified coffee at Donkey is $1.95.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We have a ton of specialty drinks. We make all of our stuff like fancy, traditional Italian style,&rdquo; Katie Campbell, barista and OU alumna, said. &ldquo;It changes every month so it gives us opportunity to do really fun things with coffee.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The drink of the month at Donkey can range from $4.30 to $4.50 for a large and $3.50 to $3.90 for a small. The price depends on how much syrup is added to the drink.</p>
        <p>Campbell said the most alluring part of Donkey is the laid-back, family-friendly atmosphere of the cafe. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s just very casual which I think a lot of times going into a new coffee shop can be intimidating but I feel like it&rsquo;s the opposite here,&rdquo; Campbell said. </p>
