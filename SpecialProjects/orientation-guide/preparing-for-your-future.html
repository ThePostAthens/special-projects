        <p><p><span class="dropcap">L</span><p>anina Smith started her first semester at Ohio University with too many commitments. Smith, a rising senior studying biochemistry, said she took 18 credit hours, started a Spanish minor and joined several clubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was involved in 80 different things at once,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Like Smith, some OU juniors and seniors advise underclassmen not to overburden themselves with coursework or pick a major they&rsquo;re not passionate about.</p>
<p>Smith said the adviser she spoke to during her freshman orientation recommended she take many classes. She tried taking too many time-consuming classes but ended up received poor grades and taking some of her introduction classes again.</p>
<p>She signed up for multiple learning communities so her classes would be organized. However, two of her classes required her to attend a lecture and lab which was more of a commitment.</p>
<p>Club involvement added more stress because Smith was active in the Lost Flamingo Theater Company, Quidditch Club and Jitterbug Club throughout the year.</p>
        
         <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/5203_6f9c6f6342e9057933dad3ad8aa1f007f.jpg" alt="Freshmen"> <p class="photog">Alex Driehaus | FILE</p><p class="pcut">ncoming students pass through the Alumni Gateway on College Green after the Freshman Convocation on Aug. 23, 2015.</p></div>
        
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest (joining) at least one (club) to get your feet wet and meet some people,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;(But) I was in a play, I was in a sport and I was dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith said she wished she would have thought more about her long-term course schedule as a freshman since many upper-level classes have prerequisites.</p>
<p>Some students had to consider college costs such as tuition and housing when they were deciding whether to attend OU.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/admissions/tuition/" style="color: #a12F5e">OU website</a>, tuition and fees for Ohio residents during the 2017-18 academic year totals $11,896.</p>
<p>Levi Brown, a rising junior studying political science, said OU was the only college that he could afford. With the commuter exemption, Brown did not have to pay for housing or a meal plan.</p>
<p>He worked three jobs in his first year at OU on top of other academic responsibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paying for school is just about impossible,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;It was very stressful, running from different jobs and doing those different assignments for scholarships and actual schoolwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown said OU also offered a few degrees that he was interested in. He liked&bull;political science but was afraid it would be &ldquo;useless.&rdquo; Brown started out studying education but switched majors during his sophomore year.</p>
<p>Looking back on his experiences as an underclassman, Brown said he should have come to OU as a political science major. That decision would have made scheduling easier and allowed him to explore other passions.</p>
<p>OU also encourages freshmen to join a <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/uc/learning-communities/benefits.cfm" style="color: #a12F5e">learning community</a>, so they can take a few general education classes with the same group of people and make friends.</p>
<p>Smith said learning communities are a good idea because they helped with scheduling courses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I joined learning communities my first year because it all mashed together and was super helpful,&rdquo; Smith said.</p>
<p>Taking on more than average credit hours load can have negative impacts on a student&rsquo;s semester, Smith said. An OU undergraduate student can take anywhere from 12 to 20 credit hours and keep a full-time student status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take more than 15 (credit hours) if you don&rsquo;t think you can handle it,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;Even if you think you can, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
