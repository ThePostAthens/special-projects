        <h1 id="headline" class="column10center">Pork and Pickles owner Becky Clark started her business to make artisan sausage and pickles </h1>
        
        <h4 id="byline" class="column20center"><a href="https://www.twitter.com/mmfernandez" target="_blank">Marisa Fernandez</a> /<span class="title"> Senior Writer</span></h4>
        
        <div class="column20center">
            <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ecky Clark accomplishes a lot in a week. She can look after her 10-month-old twin nieces for the day and watch <em>Stranger Things</em> in the evening. The next afternoon, she may butcher a 300-pound pig.
            </p>

            <p>Clark, in a pinstripe apron, yellow dangle earrings and braided brown 
                hair, spends her days butchering pigs 
                and making artisan sausage.

            </p>

            <p>“The job is absolutely disgusting,” she 
                said, smiling.</p>
        
            <p>Clark’s business, Pork and Pickles, 
                is a six-month-old startup, and her 
                pork cuts and sausages are paired 
                with several kinds of homemade pickles. Production has grown from slaughtering one pig a month to one pig a week, 
                she said.

            </p>
           
            <p>The production center she uses to make pickles and sausage is a 
            space she shares with local barbecuers — a two-story building with a wooden barn exterior in The Plains, right off a 
            gravel road from U.S. Route 33. On the 
            inside is an industrial kitchen lined 
            with wooden tables. In the back is a seven-foot walk-in freezer stocked 
            with 125 pounds of large and small sausage links, a finished product Clark ground 
            out herself in a nine-hour day. She 
            often finds herself in the kitchen until 
            3:00 a.m.
            </p>
            
               <div class="oneimg_right"><img style="width:100%" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/16171_porkandpickles_3f.jpg"><p class="photog">Emily Matthews</p><p class="photo">Becky Clark, owner of Pork and Pickles, prepares and dresses bacon in a warehouse in The Plains on Oct. 11.</p></div>
            

            
          

            <p>Making sausage involves taking a proportionate amount of lean parts 
and fatty parts of a pig and emulsifying 
them together in very cold temperatures. Other ingredients can be ground or 
mixed in.   </p>
            

            <p>The process of making sausage is not visually appealing, Clark said, 
but compared to skinning and packaging cuts from a pig, it’s easier to find the 
beauty in sausage.</p>
        
            <p>“I’m pretty immune to (butchering) at this point,” she said.</p>
            
           

            <p>Others are not so lucky. One time, a friend volunteered to help her butcher 
            a pig, but when Clark cut off the ears 
            and peeled back the flesh, her friend almost became sick at the sight. </p>
            
            <p>“And he considers himself a foodie,” Clark, 28, said, jokingly.  </p>
            
              <h2 class="subhed" id="sectionname">On the farm</h2>

            <p>Many business owners and restaurants in Athens wouldn’t hack away at a pig carcass for part of their day, she said. 
But buying and using an entire pig 
is cheaper for any business, and it is 
why she started Pork and Pickles. </p>
        
            <p>“It’s better for our profits. It’s better for our farmers,” she said. “No one else in Athens was following this concept, so I had to start doing it myself.”


            </p>
            
             

            <p>Forty minutes away in Meigs County is Dexter Run Farms, where Clark owns about 20 pigs for her business. They 
roam freely and are grass-fed for their 
time on the farm, which is about six to 
eight months. 

            </p>
            

            <p>“They have to be out grazing, loving life,” she said of her pigs. “I will 
never use a pig (if) I haven’t been to 
the farm. If there was no handshake 
with that farmer, and I haven’t set foot 
on that land, there’s no way.” </p>
            
            <div class="oneimg_center"><img style="width:100%" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/16176_porkandpickles_7f.jpg"><p class="photog">Emily Matthews</p><p class="photo">Clark puts thyme in jars that will store red onions. She stores and prepares her food in the warehouse and sells it at different locations, including the Athens Farmer's Market.</p></div>
            
        
        
            <p>Clark used to be a vegetarian, but 
                when she realized she could support humane treatment of animals by 
                owning free-range pigs, she began to 
                buy directly from farmers and to use the entire animal. </p>
            
            <p>The other half of her business is pickles. Though the pairing may seem random, it is intentionally thought out. </p>
            
            <p>“(A pickle) cleanses your palette in between bites,” she said. Fatty foods and cured meats are complemented by “something that’s really acidic.”
  </p>
            
            <p>Clark’s way of talking flavor and 
            ingredients shows her culinary background peeking through.  After earning 
            her bachelor’s degree in geography from Ohio University in 
            2009, she decided to go to the 
            Art Institute in Portland for a year. Before returning to her hometown of Athens, she worked at Cure, a Pittsburgh restaurant. Clark would butcher the entire animal for Cure’s dinner specials, an unorthodox method in restaurant service.  </p>
            
            
        
            
            <h2 class="subhed" id="sectionname">Multi-Faceted</h2>
            
                
            
            <p>Clark’s only employee, Jen Sartwell-Jones, works nights. Sartwell-Jones 
            used to be a personal chef. If Clark goes out of town, she knows Sartwell-Jones can hold down the fort.  </p>
            
            <div class="oneimg_left"><img style="width:100%" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/16172_porkandpickles_1f.jpg"><p class="photog">Emily Matthews</p><p class="photo">Clark talks to Marne Wilson, left, and Shane Wilson, right, of Parkersburg, West Virginia, at the Athens Farmer's Market on Oct. 15.</p></div>
            
            <p>When starting a business, Clark 
said the job is almost 50 percent paperwork because of the licensing requirements from the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Sartwell-Jones helps 
with paperwork as well as the food, and 
she is even helping to design a new logo for the business.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>When Clark makes sausage, it dries 
out for a few days and is weighed 
and vacuum-sealed. She recently made her seasonal coconut curry sausage, an odd yellow food that will be sold 
for $11 per pound. She often finds 
herself multitasking while making sausage, writing dates and poundage on the sausage as she simultaneously 
cooks pork bones down for stock and thaws out other cuts. 

 </p>
    
          
            
            <p>While Clark packaged sausage, Sartwell-Jone chopped five pounds of red onions — demand was so high they still needed to chop 70 more pounds of onions to pickle. The onions will be jarred and sold at the Athens Farmer’s Market.  </p>
            
              <h2 class="subhed" id="sectionname">Client Base</h2>
            
            <p>Her customers usually contact her through her Facebook page or 
through text message. But sometimes customers just come to her in person. A regular, Louie, comes ready with a crumpled checkbook after he calls Clark with an order. </p>
            
            <p>“He buys the scraps off me,” Clark said.  </p>
            
            <p>One time he bought pigskin, belly, pork butt, pig’s trotters, ears and shanks for a total of $214. She threw in the pig bones for free for his dogs. He planned to use the pigskin for pork rinds, a time-consuming ordeal, Clark said.


            </p>
            
          
            
            <p>She typically travels to the customer to make deliveries. Jackie O’s Taproom on Campbell Street has been buying Clark’s pickles since July, and customers 
            have noticed.
            </p>
            
                    <p>“We’ve been getting compliments 
                on her pickles all the time,” Stacey Kamphaus, manager of the taproom at Jackie O’s Brewery, said. “Especially because they’re local, and customers 
                love that.” </p>
            
            
            
            
            
             <div class="oneimg_center"><img style="width:100%" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/16177_porkandpickles_6f.jpg"><p class="photog">Emily Matthews</p><p class="photo">Clark pours heated juice from red onions into jars of thyme that will be used to store red onions in her warehouse in The Plains</p></div>
        
            
            <p>Though Clark moves about the 
            kitchen with ease and comfortability, 
            the space she spends a majority of 
            her time in is not hers. The countertops in the barn are sturdy 
            enough for her to butcher pigs on, 
            but she does not own them. By 
            2017, however, Clark wants to have 
            her own space so she can expand her meat 
            and pickle business. Right now, she only sells her products at the farmer’s market, but she will eventually expand her licensing to sell pork, pickles and sausage to restaurants. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Regardless of where she works, a distinctive smell will always fill 
            the workspace. 
            </p>
           
            <p>“It smells like raw meat,” she said. 
                “I definitely wouldn’t go out for a 
                drink after butchering. I’d need a 
                shower first.”</p>
