       <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he first time Ethan Samuel watched <i>Office Space</i> was several years ago with his family.</p>
        
       <p><i>Office Space</i> has an iconic scene involving a red stapler and signature characters, including a greedy boss. Those attributes contribute to the fun feel of watching movies like <i>Office Space</i>, Samuel, a junior studying communication studies, said. </p>
        
       <p>Samuel has also seen movies like <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, <i>Wayne’s World</i> and <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>. Though those movies all fall under different subgenres of film, they are all considered cult classics. </p>
        
       <p>In cinema, a cult classic is defined as a movie that is popular among a group of people or section of society.</p>
        
       <p>“It tends to be a movie that’s a little out there, more of an art film or something that is just bizarre,” Alexandra Kamody, the director of The Athena Cinema, said.</p>
        
       <p>Despite not being universally liked by everyone, cult classics hold their own in the cinematic world with their off-kilter visuals and atypical storylines that attract people who can relate to them. </p>
        
       <div><h2 class="subhed">Cult classic characteristics</h2></div>
        
      <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The term cult classic was <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-cult-film-4156574">coined in 1970</a> when more obscure films like <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show </em>and <em>Pink Flamingos</em> came to the forefront. Those movies did not do well in their first run, but they surged in theaters that screened underground movies for months on end. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With midnight movies shown on TV programming, films from the 1930s resurfaced and were labeled as cult classics, including the 1932 film <i>Freaks</i> and 1936&rsquo;s <em>Reefer Madness</em>. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of the more popular cult classics is Quentin Tarantino's <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, and it has been widely debated whether the film should be considered a cult classic because of its commercial success. In 1994, the film grossed more than $100 million at the box office and had an estimated budget of $8 million. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then there are movies like Richard Kelly&rsquo;s 2001 film <em>Donnie Darko</em>, which had a budget of $4.5 million and made just $500,000. </p>
        
        <blockquote class="pq_right">“If you are growing up and you feel on the outskirts of the mainstream society in anyway, you don’t necessarily see a lot of that reflected in the Hollywood movies.”<span class="attribution">Alexandra Kamody, director of The Athena Cinema</span></blockquote>
        
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liv Lewis, a freshman studying business law, watched <em>Donnie Darko </em>for the first time during her freshman year of high school. She clicked on a streaming site to watch the movie because she was bored and it starred one of her favorite actors, Jake Gyllenhaal. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lewis thought the movie was good, but it wasn&rsquo;t her favorite. One aspect of the movie that made it seem obscure was the &ldquo;eerie&rdquo; feeling. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t as happy as I wanted it to be,&rdquo; Lewis said. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One aspect that connects people to the more obscure films is the &ldquo;communal&rdquo; viewing experience, Kamody said. When people see a cult classic for the first time, it is often with a group of friends. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Athena, 20 S. Court St., screens cult classics often. It showed a series of film all dedicated to the genre and also shows them for Ohio University special weekends. Kamody&rsquo;s favorites include <em>Wayne&rsquo;s World </em>and <em>The Big Lebowski</em>. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What really sets cult classics apart are the subject matters. Kamody said cult classics are outside of the mainstream movies someone would see from a studio like Marvel and Disney, and they celebrate what is different. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of celebrating the quirky and the different. It&rsquo;s just all about something outside of the mainstream.&rdquo; Kamody said. &ldquo;If you are growing up and you feel on the outskirts of the mainstream society in anyway, you don&rsquo;t necessarily see a lot of that reflected in the Hollywood movies.&rdquo;</p>
        
<div><h2 class="subhed">Future cult classics</h2></div>
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Online forums have made cases for different movies and how they could become the next films to be considered cult classics. Some titles include <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>, <em>Napoleon Dynamite, Spring Breakers </em>and <em>Pineapple Express. </em></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kamody thinks the recent Oscar-nominated film <em>The Shape of Water </em>could become one of those films. Guillermo Del Toro&rsquo;s fantasy movie follows a deaf woman who falls in love with a amphibious creature being held at a government facility during the Soviet Era. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Elements of fantasy and sci-fi are not the first components that come to mind when considering cult classics, but Kamody said it is part of it whether people realize it or not. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Scott Martin, a junior study communication studies, said the 2001 comedy <em>Super Troopers </em>could also become a cult classic because of its characters and the fact it does not appeal to everyone. </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cult classics will always be watched, Martin said, because of their ever-evolving themes and soon-to-be nostalgic tones.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like going to see the new <em>Avengers movie</em>,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;(Cult classics are) good, and it&rsquo;s something to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
