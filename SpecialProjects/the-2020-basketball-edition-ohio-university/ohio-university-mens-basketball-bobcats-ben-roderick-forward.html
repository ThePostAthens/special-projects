        en Roderick caught the ball, and with a Buffalo defender closing in on him toward the left wing, he jumped and snapped his left wrist. </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>The ball snapped in the back of the net, and Ohio was on the board with a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Then he did it again and again. The freshman from Powell, who in his first home start in what’s sure to be a storied career at Ohio, gave the Bobcats just the spark they needed to open up the game against one of the Mid-American Conference’s best.</p>
        <p>His 21 points – both a game and career high – helped push Ohio past Buffalo on Tuesday night in an 80-69 win in The Convo.</p>
        <p>It was a game that Roderick needed to have. All season long, he’s dealt with injuries and trying to ease himself into being a key player for Ohio in his first season in college basketball. An ankle injury and then a broken hand limited his development. Once he was cleared, he was given a few minutes here and there just to get his body and mind right for a game atmosphere.</p>
        <p>He’s had big moments where he’s come up short. Against Northern Illinois, he missed the game-tying field goal from the top of the key in a two point loss. At Bowling Green, he could’ve potentially sealed the game if he had made the second free throw.</p>
        <p>Instead, the ball rimmed out, and the Falcons recovered. Justin Turner hit the game-winning shot with just two seconds left in a one point loss for the Bobcats.</p>
        <p>Rather than mope about and stay in his head, Roderick opened Tuesday’s game a perfect 3-for-3 from beyond-the-arc and contributed half of Ohio’s 18 points in the first 10 minutes of the game.</p>
        <p>“I just was getting up extra shots, watching film with all my coaches. Tonight (Tuesday) it just finally paid off,” Roderick said. “I’m just going to keep shooting.”</p>
        <p>Roderick’s shots came from all over the floor. The left wing, the right wing, in the middle. Simply put, the reigning Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year had the coming out party that’s been 28 games in the making.</p>
        <p>“Ben Roderick coming off the missed free throw, to have him do that performance was huge for his confidence,” coach Jeff Boals said. “In this game, confidence is everything. As a coach and as a teammate, you’ve got to build people up.”</p>
        <p>Boals credited Roderick as one of the few players who can make a contested shot of all the talent that’s on the Bobcats roster when a defender isn’t giving much space or has a hand in his face.</p>
        <p>For Roderick and his teammates, a performance such as the one against Buffalo doesn’t come as a surprise. Throughout the ups and downs that the Bobcats have experienced, Roderick has come on as of late. In their last few games, whether it’s been on the defensive end tallying up rebounds or offensively dishing out assists, the high-scoring performance was one he’s been wanting and needing.</p>
        <p>“He’s a great shooter, knock down what, his first three 3s?” Jason Preston said. “He does this.”</p>
        <p>Performances like the one against Buffalo soon won’t be seen as surprises. When he signed his letter of intent to play at Ohio, the 6 feet, 5 inch forward became the highest-rated recruit to sign and commit in program history.</p>
        <p>“I just think it built up my confidence,” he said. “Especially getting the lead and holding that lead is what we have trouble with. It was good to come out with a win.”</p>
        <p>Despite his injuries, he’s developed into a vital bench player, and with Lunden McDay working through an injury, Roderick might have bought himself more time in the starting five – especially with Ohio needing to close out the season strong to host a first round tournament game.</p>
        <p>“Him being in a close game like he was against Bowling Green, it’s going to help him in the long run. It’s going to help us in the long run,” Boals said. “He’s going to be a big part of our future.”</p>
        <p>When the final horn blared, signalling the Bobcats’ victory over their fellow Mid-American Conference rival, Roderick wiped the sweat from his brow and began shaking hands with the opponents.</p>
        <p>Then, when he and his teammates traced the perimeter of the court high-fiving their fans, he let his guard down and smiled, knowing he was a difference maker.</p>
        <p>Not only on Tuesday, but for the rest of his career.</p>
