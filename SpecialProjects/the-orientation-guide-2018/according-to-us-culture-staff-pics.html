        <p>There is so much to love about Athens, but a few things in particular stick out as the best. Here’s what the culture staffers of The Post picked as their Athens essentials.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite place to eat Uptown:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis Eichelberger</b>: Casa Nueva. I only get it when my parents come to town, but it’s worth the wait, and they use tons of yummy local ingredients.</p>
        
        <p><b>Baylee DeMuth</b>: Big Mamma’s Burritos. It has this burrito called a Loaded Mamma and it tastes just like Taco Bell’s loaded potato griller but much, much better.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica Hill</b>: Bagel Street Deli is the best. It’s cheap (and) delicious, and there are so many options. The MacGyger, Flaming Moe and Tom’s Turkey are all great sandwiches.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess Umbarger</b>: Court Street Diner. It serves breakfasts at all hours, so it’s my favorite. The milkshakes are also great.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin Pan</b>: Peking Express. It's tucked away in a shared building, so no one ever seems to know about it — which means most of the time, they have what you want. Also, if you go after 8 p.m., they tend to pile on an insane amount of food since they don’t want to waste anything before they close. They also occasionally have a $3.75 deal if you come in after 8 p.m.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia Davis</b>: Ginger Asian Kitchen. It’s a good vegetarian option, but I personally like my noodles with meat and veggies.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite place to study:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: The top floor of Alden Library is spooky quiet, and the view is nice if you can get a seat near a window.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: This might be cliche, but Donkey Coffee and Espresso has the best study vibes. Chill music is always playing, and if you start to get burnt out you can grab a coffee or play a game.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess</b>: The sixth or seventh floor of Alden is always a good option. You can exclude yourself in a corner or look out a window. Just be careful, it can be easy to get lost up there.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: What’s studying?</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: In my bed.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite green:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: East Green is the prettiest, but the hills are killer. You win some, you lose some.</p>
        
        <p><b>Baylee</b>: East Green is by far the best, especially when it’s autumn. I always find myself taking it all in as if I’m seeing it all for the first time.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: West Green is the best. It has the best dining hall, it’s in its own separate world, and it has a huge green space for playing frisbee or just hanging out.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess</b>: East Green is so pretty and feels like a different world, especially when the leaves change in the fall or right after it snows.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: You know it’s the best because it rhymes. What other reason do you need?</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: WEST IS BEST.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite dining hall:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: Boyd Dining Hall has the best healthy stuff, and it’s definitely the most vegetarian friendly.</p>
        
        <p><b>Baylee</b>: Nelson is my favorite dining hall. I’ve actually heard a lot of people not liking Nelson, but all-day breakfast? I would eat waffles all day, every day if I could.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: Boyd is the best. It has the most healthy options.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess</b>: Nelson has breakfast all day. ‘Nuff said.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: Boyd all day. Its rotisserie chicken is amazing.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: Shively Dining Hall is good for comfort food. Nelson is good for breakfast all day. But Boyd has the best quality. Also, appreciate a meal plan while you have one. You will miss it when you move off campus.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite Uptown shop:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: Athens Underground is so much fun. Even if you’re not planning on buying anything, it’s an adventure just to look around and see what you find.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: Retweet to Athens Underground. It has the most personality, and it’s always fun to look at everything the store has to offer.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess</b>: Bluetique has super cute and trendy stuff, and there are always good sales.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: I love shopping at Chipotle. I walk out with a purchase I’m happy with 100 percent of the time. Also, occasionally they have good deals like free chips and guac.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: Artifacts Gallery has a lot of cool local goods and really funny socks.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite place to relax:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: I’ve taken some of my best naps in the egg chairs in Alden, and I hope to someday buy one for my home.</p>
     
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: Donkey Coffee is both my favorite place to study and place to relax. It’s a multi-purpose coffee shop.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: The balcony on the fourth floor of Baker University Center is a hidden gem. Not the side the Front Room Coffeehouse is on, the side with the ballroom. You get a perfect view of the sunset, and it’s just an all-around great place to take in the view of campus.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: The same place as my favorite place to study (bed).</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite place to grab coffee:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: Donkey Coffee. It’s all fair trade, and the atmosphere is great for studying and just hanging out, too</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: Donkey Coffee. The coffee is delicious and non-corporate.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess</b>: Fluff Bakery for sure. The pastries are also amazing.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: Chipotle. If it served coffee, I’m sure it’d be my favorite.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: Court Street Coffee or Donkey Coffee. The local coffee shops here are the best.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite place to enjoy nature:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: My absolute favorite thing to do when the weather is nice is to ride my bike on the bike path.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: The River Valley Nature Trail at the Ridges is very peaceful and offers some great meadows to relax and have a picnic.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jess</b>: The trails at the Ridges are great at any time of day. It’s always quiet and they have some great views.</p>
        
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: What is there to enjoy? I prefer the great indoors.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: I like to toss a Frisbee on College Green. It’s great place to look at trees.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Favorite thing about Athens:</h2></div>
        
        <p><b>Alexis</b>: I love how much Athens people love Athens. There’s lots of local pride that translates as support for local businesses and environmental consciousness and other things that just make the culture of the whole town really special.</p>
        
        <p><b>Jessica</b>: I love how you can meet people with such different backgrounds and stories from your own. You can talk to someone from the opposite side of the world, and you can learn so much from them. Athens is a hub for diversity, if you look for it.</p>
       
        <p><b>Kevin</b>: Favorite thing about Athens? Probably all of Athens. It’s hard to sum up in a few words, but you’ll understand what I’m talking about after a year here. “Athens happens” is a good motto to sum it all up.</p>
        
        <p><b>Georgia</b>: There’s just something about the atmosphere in Athens. The moment I stepped on the red bricks, I knew I wanted to call it home.</p>
