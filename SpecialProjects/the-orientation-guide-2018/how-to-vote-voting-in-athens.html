        <p>Whether you are moving to Ohio University from out of state or commuting from a couple of streets over, most incoming students are eligible to register to vote in the state of Ohio.</p>
        
        <p>There are three elections happening in 2018 in which Athens voters can participate: the primary May 8, the special election Aug. 7 and the general election Nov. 6.</p>
        
        <p>To be qualified to vote you need to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years of age on or before the day of the election and be an Ohio resident for at least 30 days before the election.</p>
        
        <p>The deadline to register for the primary has already passed. To vote in the other two elections, you can register before July 9 for the special election or Oct. 9 for the general election.</p>
        
        <p>To register to vote as an Athens resident, you can register in person, by mail or through an online option on the Ohio secretary of state’s<a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/voters/register/">website</a>. To vote absentee, you must submit an application to request a ballot at least three days before the election. The ballot must be postmarked no later than the day before the election and received by the Athens County Board of Elections no later than 10 days after the election or returned to the Board of Elections by 7:30 p.m. on election night to be counted.</p>
        
        <p>For the upcoming primary election, Athens voters will decide on candidates running for the offices of Ohio’s governor, state treasurer, Court of Appeals judges, U.S. senator, U.S. representative and other various offices. You will need to register to vote with one of the political parties or as an unaffiliated voter. The candidates chosen through the primary will move on to the general election to run against those chosen by the other parties.</p>
        
        <p>Voters will also see two statewide issues including a plan to create a bipartisan public process for drawing congressional districts and whether <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/02/sopec-money-athens-ohio">the Southeast Ohio Public Energy Council</a>, or SOPEC, is allowed to levy a retail carbon fee based on energy consumption used by SOPEC in Athens. Those issues will be decided through the primary election and will not appear on the ballot in the special or general election.</p>
        
        <p>The Board of Elections office is located at 15 S. Court St. The regular office hours are Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. To contact the people working in the office, you can call 740 592-3201 or email athens@ohiosecretaryofstate.gov. At the office, all your voting needs can be taken care of and all your election questions answered.</p>
