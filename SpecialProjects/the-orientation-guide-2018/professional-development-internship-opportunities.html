        <p>Although it is four years away, there is no better time for incoming freshman to start working on their professional development.</p>

        <p>Fortunately for students, Ohio University provides resources and advice to guide students toward post-graduate employment.</p>

        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/4f8cfbb5-4ef2-4a89-af31-e6df560f532c.sized-1000x1000.png" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Rilee Lockhart | ILLUSTRATION</p></div>

        <p>The Career and Leadership Development Center is a resource at OU that provides career coaching, leadership development, mock interviews and more. The CLDC offers those services year-round as well as events like the Career and Internship Fair, JobFest and various other career, recruitment and networking events.</p>

        <p>Resumes and cover letters are two of the most important things employers look at when they are hiring. Those documents give an outline of the potential employee’s qualifications for the job they are applying for.</p>

        <p>OU’s College of Business provides templates on its <a href="https://business.ohio.edu/resources/career-management/enhance-resumes-and-cover-letters/"> website</a>for cover letters and resumes, as well as guidelines for students to build professional skills.</p>

        <p>Internships are another way students can prepare for their future careers. To search for internships, students can go to networking websites such as LinkedIn or Indeed. OU uses Handshake, a career platform for job searching and networking. Because many programs at OU require an internship to graduate with the degree, departments such as the Scripps College of Communication send out internship newsletters or have links to internship opportunities on their websites.</p>

        <p>Student and campus organizations provide experiences employers value and opportunities for students to gain professional connections. Organizations provide students with the opportunity to gain relevant experience for future careers or development leadership skills. By getting involved on campus, students can also gain a network of current students and alumni who share their career goals and interests.</p>

        <p>OU has a wide variety of organizations that students can join that fit their interests and career aspirations. To see the organizations OU has to offer, students can visit OrgSync and login with an Ohio I.D. to search through those organizations or visit the involvement fair on College Green at the beginning of the academic year.</p>
