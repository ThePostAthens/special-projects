        <p>Transitioning to and managing the stress of college can be difficult. Luckily, there are some designated spaces on Ohio University’s campus that can serve as escapes for students who may need a place to relax and know they are secure and supported.</p>
        
        <p>Places such as the Women’s, Multicultural and LGBT Centers and the recently-added meditation room in Alden Library provide students, faculty and staff with secure places to express themselves freely and openly. Here’s a bit about each location and where to find them:</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Multicultural Center - Baker Center 205</h2></div>
        
        <p>Maintained through the OU Office for Diversity and Inclusion, the <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/culturalcenter/about.cfm">Multicultural Center </a>serves as a place of cultural teaching and learning. Students, faculty and staff representing a range of cultural identities and backgrounds use the center as a medium for extracurricular involvement and connection with others through additional programming. The Multicultural Center is open from 8 a.m. - 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 8 a.m. - 8 p.m. on Friday.</p>
        
        <p>D’Asia Leathers, a recent graduate who studied journalism, said for many multicultural students, the center serves as a place where they can spend time and be themselves, whether it just be to socialize or to expressive themselves through student organizations.</p>
        
        <p>“I think the Multicultural Center is a safe space, just given the nature of the center and what all we do here and its purposes,” Leathers said.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Women’s Center - Baker Center 403</h2></div>
        
        <p>The OU Women’s Center offers a helpful and relaxing atmosphere to all, especially female-identifying people. Decorated with colorful posters with feminist messages hung over comfy couches, the center is a comfortable and cheery spot situated in the back corner of the fourth floor of Baker Center.</p>
        
        <p>According to its <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/womenscenter/index.cfm">website</a>, the Women’s Center offers support for both undergraduate and graduate students, help with research and extracurricular programs. Lactation rooms are accessible for those who need them, and more than 1,000 books on gender-related topics are available for checkout. The center is open weekdays from 8 a.m.-5 p.m.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">LGBT Center - Baker Center 354</h2></div>
        
        <p>As the first of its kind in the state of Ohio, the <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/">LGBT Center </a>has been a strong voice with a clear message: All are welcome. People of all genders, orientations and identities are welcome in the rainbow-hued center tucked away in the hall of administrative offices in Baker Center. In addition to serving as a place to decompress, the LGBT Center provides a range of events and organizations for students and a wealth of information on LGBT-related topics.</p>

        <br><br>
        
        <p>Camry Carey, a recent graduate who studied sociology-criminology and a student employee at the LGBT Center, said the center prioritizes offering a safe environment to people of all identities. She said she considered the center to be a personal place of security for her, even if she is just there to hang out and watch TV.</p>
        
        <p>“We’re here to support you in any way you need and want,” Carey said. “If you need that comfort or that kinship, we can be that affirmation for someone.”</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Meditation room - Alden Library fifth floor</h2></div>
        
        <p>The meditation room in Alden Library, the creation of which was spearheaded by a former student president of the International Student Union, has provided a quiet place for students of all spiritual and religious identities to pray, meditate or simply unwind. <a href="https://www.library.ohio.edu/about/administration/policies-and-procedures/meditation-room/">Guidelines </a>for the meditation room include silence and mutual respect for others using the room.</p>
        
        <p>The meditation room is meant to highlight inclusivity and show the religious diversity of OU and Athens, according to a <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/08/meditation-room-alden-library">previous Post report.</a> </p>
