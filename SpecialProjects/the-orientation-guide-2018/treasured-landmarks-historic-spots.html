        <p>From College Green to Court Street, Ohio University has no shortage of picturesque college town landmarks.</p>
        
        <p>Certain spots on campus, however, are less well known. Here’s a rundown of the stories behind some of the sites that make OU’s campus unique:</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The Cherry Blossoms</h2></div>
        
        <p>For just a few weeks each April, the banks of the Hocking River teem with the flowers of pink cherry blossom trees — one of the earliest signs that spring is near.</p>
        
        <p>Since they were first brought to Athens in 1979, more than 200 cherry trees bloom on campus each year. They were a gift from President Kazuo Yamada of Chubu University — OU’s sister school in Japan — and a representation of the close relationship between the universities. </p>
        
        <p>As is customary in Japan, the trees between the bike path and the Convocation Center are illuminated. They typically bloom for about two weeks. </p>
        
        <p>In early April, the Japanese Language and Culture Association celebrates the blooming of the cherry blossoms with its annual Sakura Festival, which features traditional Japanese food and culture. April also marks the beginning of the new year in Japan.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Class Gateway and the Seal</h2></div>
        
        <p>The Class Gateway, a gift from the OU Class of 1949, was built in 1960 on the original site of a gateway donated by the Class of 1912.</p>
        
        <p>Embedded in the brick in between the arches is a bronze replica of the Great Seal of the State of Ohio. Be careful, though. Legend has it that those who step on the seal don’t graduate.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The Kissing Circle</h2></div>
        
         
        <div class="oneimg_left"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/3dee74af-d815-4ad3-bbf6-a59ce90f6bf5.sized-1000x1000.jpg" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Meagan Hall | DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY</p><p class="pcut">The Kissing Circle, located on College Green.</p> </div>
        
        <p>Grab your significant other and head to College Green for this time-honored OU landmark.</p>
       
        
        <p>There are two sides to the kissing circle tradition at OU. According to one tradition, two people who step foot in the circle at the same time are supposed to exchange a kiss. Under the more commonly held tradition, however, two people who kiss in the circle are destined to be together forever.</p>
        
        <p>The circle is located on College Green, near Chubb Hall, and is marked by a bronze plaque at the intersection of four brick walkways.</p>
        
        <p>“The Kissing Circle holds fond memories for decades of Ohio University alumni and symbolizes our affection and dedication to one another,” the plaque, dedicated by the Class of 2005, states. “May it remind future students, as it has those of the past, of valued friendships formed here and inspire loyalty to our school.”</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Wolfe Garden </h2></div>
        
        <p>Feeling homesick? Head to Wolfe Garden for some quiet contemplation.</p>
        
        <p>In between Cutler Hall and Alden Library, the shady garden may appear like any other, but was actually built in the shape of Ohio. The garden was named for 1919 alumnus Thomas J. Wolfe, whose words can be found engraved on a plaque on the Wilson Hall side of the garden. </p>
        
        <p>"Let us hope, that we who are privileged to be part of a long illustrious line, may have an abiding interest in the things of the mind, the pursuit of truth, the contemplation of beauty, and the attainment of the good life,” reads the plaque. </p>
        
         <p>In the middle of the garden is a bronze sculpture, created by School of Art faculty member David Hostetler and titled “The American Woman.”</p>
