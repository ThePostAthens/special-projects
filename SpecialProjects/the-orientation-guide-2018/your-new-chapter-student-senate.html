        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>I still remember bursting out of the Convocation Center like it was yesterday. Being pushed by the tide of other first-year students as we made our way from our freshman convocation to College Green, taking over the bricks as our own for the very first time.</p>
        
        <p>Although the stress and nerves of my first weekend in college were overwhelming, I can still vividly remember walking under College Gate and thinking, “I’m crossing into a new chapter of my life today.”</p>
        
        <p>Since then, Ohio University has provided me with so many adventures and opportunities that I could have only dreamed of, experiences available to all of you as you become Bobcats.</p>
        
        <p>In my time at OU so far, I’ve created my own student organization, worked as an resident assistant and assistant resident director in Housing and Residence Life, connected with Bobcat alumni all across the country, collaborated with dedicated professors and administrators and, most recently, became president of OU’s Student Senate. I may be slightly biased, but I firmly believe that those experiences could only happen here, in the beautiful college town of Athens, Ohio.</p>
        
        <p>I encourage all of you to make the most of your time here. With so many student organizations, research opportunities, campus and community jobs, and university events, there are countless ways you can take advantage of everything that OU has to offer. While these experiences can help prepare you for future careers and professional goals, the most important part of campus involvement is the people you meet and the relationships you build in the process. The best part about being a Bobcat is joining our Bobcat family, and I look forward to seeing the new relationships created in the following year.</p>
        
        <p>If you are interested in becoming part of a student organization that helps to advocate for students on a larger scale, I recommend that you look into OU’s Student Senate organization. Our members represent all students on campus, helping to bring student ideas and concerns to administrators and faculty and create tangible change. Last year, we institutionalized the funding of menstrual products in campus restrooms and addressed campus concerns about textbook affordability, diversity in faculty hires and campus free speech. </p>
        
        <p>As the incoming Student Senate president, I’m excited to see the innovation and passion that your class brings to campus, and I hope that you will consider sharing some of those ideas with Student Senate.</p>
        
        <p>I look forward to watching the ways in which your class takes to the bricks and makes this campus your own in the next several years. As you cross into the next chapter of your life, remember to take advantage of and enjoy every new opportunity that this university provides.</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to our Bobcat family.</p>
