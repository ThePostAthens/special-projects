        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he past academic year was a busy year for <i>The Post.</i> Here are a couple of the biggest stories:</p>

         <div><h2 class="subhed">Sexual assaults</h2></div>
        <p>The Ohio University Police Department and the Athens Police Department received 13 reports of sexual assaults since Jan. 13. During the Fall Semester, there were 27 reports of sexual assault to OUPD and APD.</p>

        <p>Ohio University had the third highest number of reported sexual assaults during the “red zone” period compared to other Ohio MAC universities, <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/11/ohio-university-mac-red-zone-sexual-assault">according to a previous <i>Post</i> report.</a> The red zone, which is the first six weeks of the academic year, is when there are increased reports of sexual assault on university campuses, according to a <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/424768/original/2008.kimble.uws.pdf">Journal of American College Health Study</a>. OUPD had nine reports of sexual assault during the red zone.</p>

        <p>To bring attention to the issue of sexual assault, students held different events throughout the academic year.</p>
 <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/6a21ed03-7dfb-4cb5-b160-e58458e0cf38.sized-1000x1000.jpeg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">HANNAH RUHOFF | FOR THE POST</p><p class="pcut">Mallory Golski embraces another protestor during the It's On Us Bobcats rally against sexual abuse on Sept. 27, 2018 outside Cutler Hall. </p> </div>
        <p>“It’s on Us, Bobcats” was a rally and march that took place in September as a call for an end to sexual assault on campus and to express support for sexual assault victims. There were about 500 students at the rally. At the time of the rally, there had been 15 reports of rape and sexual imposition.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">LGBT Center</h2></div>
        <p>The then-director of the LGBT Center, delfin bautista, was not renewed for their contract in January. bautista, who uses they/them pronouns and does not capitalize letters in their name, was put on administrative leave until June 30, according to a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2019/01/ohio-university-lgbt-center-delfin-bautista">previous <i>Post</i> report.</a></p>

        <p>After bautista was removed, about 60 students, faculty members and Athens residents gathered outside Cutler Hall. They protested, criticizing the university’s unexpected and hasty decision to remove bautista.</p>

        <p>OU has selected an assistant director, but it will continue the search for a director in the fall.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Sigma Pi</h2></div>
        <p>Ohio University permanently expelled the Epsilon chapter of the Sigma Pi fraternity April 11 after an incident where a student was found unresponsive in an unofficial annex of the fraternity during the Fall Semester.</p>

        <p>Collin Wiant, 18, of Dublin, a freshman and pledge of Sigma Pi Epsilon, was later pronounced dead at OhioHealth O’Bleness Hospital, according to a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/11/ohio-university-sigma-pi-collin-wiant-student-death">previous <i>Post</i> report.</a></p>.

        <p>A university hearing board found the fraternity in violation of endangerment, brutality, coerced consumption, coerced activities, destruction or damage to property, selling or distributing alcoholic beverages, allowing underage students to drink alcohol, unlawful use or possession of other controlled substances, physical harm or threat to a person and reckless action that poses a harm to others.</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">Board of Trustees’ Decisions</h2></div>

        <p>In the January Board of Trustees meeting, members approved a 3.5 percent tuition increase for the 2020 fiscal year. A main reason for the about $200 increase was •low enrollment, according to a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2019/01/ohio-university-board-of-trustees-tuition-increase-budget">previous <i>Post</i> report.</a></p>

        <p>In the March meetings, members approved the demolition and repurposing of several university houses and buildings at the Ridges.
