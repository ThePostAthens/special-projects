        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Ohio University Board of Trustees approved a 3.5 percent tuition increase in their January meeting.</p>

        <p>If the State of Ohio approves a 2 percent state tuition cap, Ohio residents’ annual tuition will increase from about $12,192 to about $12,618, according to a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2019/01/board-of-trustees-tuition-increase-ohio-university">previous Post report.</a></p>

        <p>The housing payment would increase from about $6,822 to about $7,060 for Ohio residents. Dining costs would increase from about $5,790 to about $5,905.</p>

        <p>The increase in tuition is partly due to the amount of college-bound students in the Midwest decreasing, Chaden Djalali, executive vice president and provost, said in a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2019/01/ohio-university-board-of-trustees-tuition-increase-budget">previous Post report.</a></p>

        <p>This is the first time tuition has increased in four years.</p>
        
         <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/f4183c7a-99d2-45c7-9a68-782c7fe5d306.sized-1000x1000.png" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">ILLUSTRATION | RILEE LOCKHART</p><p class="pcut"></p> </div>
        
        <p>Tuition is based on the amount of credit hours students are taking. If a student is full time, which is a student taking more than 12 credit hours, the cost is capped until 20 credit hours.</p>

        <p>The normal amount of credit hours is 15 for one semester.</p>

        <p>For Ohio residents, any more than 20 credit hours is a $247 fee per credit hour and for out-of-state students, the fee is $478 per credit hour.</p>

        <p>The full cost for tuition for full-time Ohio residents below 20 credit hours is $5,372 while the out-of-state total is $10,010.</p>
        
        <p>The OHIO Guarantee confirms that whatever the tuition, housing, dining and fee rates is set at when a student enrolls will remain the same for four years, according to OU’s website.</p>

        <p>There are five tuition-related fees that are added to the cost of attending OU.</p>

        <p>The instructional fee covers the associated costs with instruction, according to <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/bursar/undergraduate-tuition">OU’s website.</a></p>

        <p>The next fee is the general fee, which funds services and activities to promote students’ emotional and physical well-being and cultural and social development outside class.</p>
        
        <p>The non-resident surcharge fee requires out-of-state students to pay the fee “to fund instructional costs the state pays for on behalf of qualifying Ohio residents,” according to OU’s website.</p>

        <p>The technology fee is dependent on the student’s college. It supports technology usage in classrooms and labs.</p>

        <p>The student info system/network fee funds the information technology and undergraduate, graduate and professional students in all programs are required to pay it.</p>

        <p>In 2017, which is the most recent year in the Ohio University Factbook, there were 17,925 undergraduate students at OU. This is down 1.6 percent from 2016.</p>
        
        <p>Including eLearning students and regional campus students, there are 29,985 undergraduate students.</p>

        <p>However, the 2020 fiscal year will see an increase in scholarship support for the third consecutive year, according to a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2019/01/board-of-trustees-tuition-increase-ohio-university">previous Post report.</a> Auxiliaries have also budgeted an additional $500,000 toward instructional scholarships.</p>

        <p>OU’s 2019 fiscal year projected earnings was $47.8 million, but OU was down about $13 million in January. David Guame, OU’s director of investments, credited this to the volatile stock market in December.</p>
