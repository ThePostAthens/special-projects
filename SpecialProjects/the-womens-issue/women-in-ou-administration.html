        <p>Ohio University’s female leaders know firsthand that occupying high-up positions in a male-dominated field doesn’t necessarily mean equal treatment.</p>
        
        <p>In a 2013 column for The Student Affairs Feature, OU Dean of Students Jenny Hall-Jones said she had never had sexist attitudes directed at her until she became a dean of students. Although she “knew it existed,” sexist discrimination was always on the outside — beyond the walls of her home and office.</p>
        
        <p>Hall-Jones remembers giving a presentation to a group of incoming students during orientation. It was, as she wrote in 2013, “a disaster.”</p>
        
         <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/9c40d7f6-3968-4e48-997a-9d04037149ba.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">OLIVER HAMLIN | FILE</p><p class="pcut">Jenny Hall-Jones poses for a portrait in her office on April 6th, 2016.</p> </div>
        
        <p>Students tweeted about her clothing during the presentation, making fun of her red shoes and her Wizard of Oz outfit.</p>
        
        <p>“Does anyone else want to bang her?” one incoming student wrote a few days later. Another inappropriate comment soon followed. When Hall-Jones tweeted back to challenge it, she was greeted with a swift and crude reply.</p>
        
        <p>“F--- you,” the student tweeted.</p>
        
        <p>Those types of comments and experiences, Hall-Jones said, simply didn’t happen to the former dean of students, who was a man. Five years later, the disastrous presentation is in the past, but Hall-Jones said the day-to-day microaggressions persist.</p>
        
        <p>While women tend to come to her office to talk about leadership and mentoring opportunities, Hall-Jones said men are more likely to come in looking for a maternal figure. It’s an observation that Hall-Jones shared with former Dean of Students Ryan Lombardi, who one student said was like “the cool uncle” to students. Hall-Jones, meanwhile, was “like our mom.”</p>
        
        <p>“It is interesting, from a research perspective,” Hall-Jones said. “It’s not my job to ‘mom’ anybody.”</p>
        
        <p>For interim Executive Vice President and Provost Elizabeth Sayrs, a history of research and work in feminist theory and gender studies would present themes that came into play in her career.</p>
        
        <p>“I’ve had the same experiences many women in academia have had,” Sayrs said in an email. “For example, people sometimes assume I am the administrative assistant instead of a professor or a dean, or I will have a series of meetings where I am the only woman in the room.”</p>
        
        <p>Only about a quarter of college presidents in the U.S. are women, according to a 2011 report by the American Council on Education. In its 214-year history, OU has never had a woman serve as president.</p>
        
        <p>And despite accounting for more than half the total workforce, many women employed at OU make less than their male counterparts. The average salary of a male tenure-track professor is about $94,000. The average female tenure-track professor makes about $7,400 less, according to a previous Post report.</p>
        
        <p>Vice President for Finance and Administration Deborah Shaffer — once a first-generation student with a passion for numbers — is the first woman to hold her current office at OU. It was a similar story in her previous position at Carnegie Mellon University, where Shaffer was the school’s first female vice president for finance and chief financial officer.</p>
        
        <p>“I’ve been incredibly fortunate to be a part of executive teams, and to have served under presidents, where I felt respected and where gender was not a factor,” Shaffer said in an email. “However, it would be disingenuous for me to suggest I have not encountered gender bias.”</p>
        
        <p>Shaffer said she has found that gender bias and cultural expectations can present special challenges to women, especially when it comes to direct communication — a trait she said is “often admired in men.”</p>
        
        <p>Sayrs credits “strong mentorship” from her OU colleagues, who she said have helped her navigate difficult issues.</p>
        
        <p>“Be the best mentor you can be, especially to each other,” Sayrs said in an email. “Finding an effective and authentic way to lead takes practice and a lot of feedback, so having a close group of colleagues you can trust and share ideas and questions with is really helpful.”</p>
