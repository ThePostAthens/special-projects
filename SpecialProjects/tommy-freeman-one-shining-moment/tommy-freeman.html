<p>Ohio's coaching staff was drained.</p>
<p>No. 14&nbsp;Ohio had just beaten No. 3 Georgetown 97-83 in the 2010 NCAA Tournament. It was&nbsp;one of the biggest upsets in tournament history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staff had spent all night studying Tennessee, Ohio's next opponent. The Bobcats had to play the Volunteers&nbsp;in two days.&nbsp;It was a whirlwind of a day for the team that shouldn't have even been there.</p>
<p>So when preparation was done, the coaching staff emerged from&nbsp;the meeting room groggy, sleep-deprived, and running on Cloud Nine. They emerged from the room at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>But before they could head to their respective rooms, the morning paper caught their eyes. It was the March 19, 2010 edition&nbsp;of <em>USA Today.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The headline read, "Upsets rattle the brackets." It was a picture of Ohio forward&nbsp;DeVaughn Washington, arms at his side, yelling with passion over the previous night's&nbsp;upset.</p>
<p>"We&rsquo;re walking out of the room, we look tired, we look down and we&rsquo;re like &lsquo;Oh man, this is real. This was a big moment,&rsquo; " current-assistant coach Aaron Fuss said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet, for a team that accomplished such a historic upset, it might not have even happened if it wasn't for a shot that occurred just 22 days earlier.</p>
<h2 class="subhed">The build up</h2>
<p>Tommy Freeman's Ohio career was anything but average. He left as the program's leading 3-point shooter, having made 44.3 percent of his attempts. He even shot 47.7 from deep in that&nbsp;2010&nbsp;season. But unfortunately for Freeman, his team was a perfect personification of the word average.</p>
<p>The Bobcats entered the month of February at 11-10 and 2-5 in the Mid-American Conference. Hardly MAC Championship worthy, let alone NCAA Tournament worthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were really up and down with the young guys we had," Freeman said.&nbsp;"The strides we took to end up where we did, a lot of those MAC games were really trying, we lost a lot of close ones that year. Taking those MAC games as learning experiences, figuring out a way to win.&rdquo;</p>
 <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/12221_123bf6d42087ae860b840a2af4e341e1f.jpg"><p class="photog">Alex Goodlett</p><p class="pcut">(From left to right) Tommy Freeman, DeVaughn Washington, John Groce, Asown Sayles and Adetunji Adedipe pose for a picture Mar. 1 in The Convo. Four seniors were honored before playing Akron in the seasonâ€™s last home game. Ohio won 80-55.</p> </div>
<p>Ohio's record wasn't much better at the end of the month, either. Heading into the week of Feb. 24, Ohio was just 15-13. But then, something clicked.</p>
<p>"Usually the task at hand is the day in front of you, you&rsquo;re trying not to get too far out in front of yourself," then-assistant coach Chris Holtmann said.&nbsp;"I just remember (coach) John (Groce) echoing those thoughts to our group, communicating that with them over and over."</p>
<p>It was Groce, amongst the others, who helped push Ohio on a run that would end up as just the 12th trip to the NCAA Tournament appearance.</p>
<p>But for now, Ohio had to beat its rival. It's biggest rival. And the stakes, at the time, were just as big as they always were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here nine years now," Fuss said.&nbsp;"It doesn&rsquo;t matter who the good teams are in the league, Miami could be the 12 seed or the one seed, that is a big game. That means a lot to our players, a lot to our fans, we were approaching that as the biggest game on our schedule.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="subhed">The shot</h2>
<p>Ohio trailed by six at halftime, but rallied back to take the lead from Miami as the second half wore on. It was a classic rivalry between two classic teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very competitive game in a great atmosphere," Ohio play-by-play man Russ Eisenstein said.&nbsp;"Back and forth, it was what an Ohio-Miami game should be like and hopefully many, many more of them are going to be like that in the future again."</p>
<p>With just seconds remaining, Miami sunk a layup to what many thought would sink Ohio. The Bobcats trailed 68-67.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_left"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/4616_5215cb005d1b17a0d8928a8ad615ad0df.jpg"><p class="photog">Maddie Meyer</p><p class="pcut">
Forward Tommy Freeman takes a shot during the game Feb. 9 against Toledo in The Convo. Ohio won 71-58.</p></div>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of a broken play, at seven seconds, your goal is to get a good shot," Fuss, the then-Director of Basketball Operations said.&nbsp;"It was a clean look at the rim, Arman actually got scored on right before that, he&rsquo;s under the rim, he took it out of bounds. That put him out of the play, Tommy was the only guy up there and available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D.J. Cooper raced up the floor with time running down, but as he neared the left wing, four RedHawks converged on him. He passed to the only man open &mdash; Freeman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freeman took the pass on the right win, pump-faked, side-stepped left&nbsp;and with help from a&nbsp;screen from Kenneth van Kempen, fired up his shot.</p>
<p>"I do know ... maybe this is ridiculous, but there was no way he was going to miss that shot," Fuss said.</p>
<p>Fuss was right. With just over one second left,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6ToCRgH8fg" target="_blank">Freeman's shot hit the bottom of the net.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I started running to the bench when the horn sounded," Freeman said.&nbsp;"Then I got lifted up and carried to the sideline, everybody is on the court and I&rsquo;m coming out the backside. To be part of that historic rivalry that&rsquo;s been taking place for so long, to be apart of that history, is something I hold close to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Freeman's first and only&nbsp;buzzer beater of the sharpshooter's career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy was a guy known for making the big shots," Holtmann said.&nbsp;"He had that clutch gene that you look for in guys, the moment wasn&rsquo;t too big for him. We had a lot of shotmakers on that team, but he was prolific in his ability to make big shots."</p>
<p>The crowd rushed the floor to celebrate the win as Freeman walked back toward the bench. It was quite possibly the biggest shot in the rivalry's history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a rivalry game against your arch nemesis, that&rsquo;s one of the, if not the biggest shots I&rsquo;ve ever taken and made," Freeman said.&nbsp;"It&rsquo;ll be one I tell my kids and grandkids about, one that I can show them in years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miami's coach at the time, the late Charlie Coles, was probably the most historic part of the rivalry. His red turtleneck became a staple around the MAC and through the rivalry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coles' postgame press conference that night still makes Freeman smile.</p>
<p>Feeman said he remembers Coles saying at the time, " 'I was telling them to find Freeman. Somehow they didn&rsquo;t.' "</p>
<p>Freeman spent the next day reveling in his shot. The team was fully energized, but even with just one senior on the team, finally saw their youth growing.</p>
<p>"Going to class the next day, obviously it was in <em>The Post,</em> people were saying &lsquo;Great shot last night!&rsquo;" Freeman said. "It&rsquo;s cool to be on SportsCenter whenever you can be, bring Ohio to the national stage."</p>
<p>His shot energized a rivalry and for one night, pushed Ohio to national prominence. Little did he know, there was more to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just one of those memories that I&rsquo;ll always have, and will continue to make me smile for a long, long time," Freeman said."</p>
<h2 class="subhed">The aftermath</h2>
        
    <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/7671_eb3ba1cb077732ad791bca3e8e587932f.jpg"><p class="photog">Alex Goodlett</p><p class="pcut">Former Ohio forward Tommy Freeman takes a shot over a Toledo defender in The Convo. Freeman signed with the Worcester Wolves after finishing his Ohio career.</p></div>
<p>Ohio's season wasn't over at that point, not by any stretch. No. 9 in the MAC Tournament, the Bobcats had to come from behind against Ball State on the road and win in overtime. Then Ohio reeled off three-straight wins in Cleveland, including once again over Miami, to win the MAC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We definitely used it as a momentum builder going to the MAC Tournament," Freeman said. He then paused and later continued,&nbsp;&ldquo;Miami, when we saw them in Cleveland, had no chance after that."</p>
<p>Holtmann would end up at Gardner-Webb the next season and is currently the coach at Butler. Groce is currently the coach at Illinois. All of the assistants from that year's team are now in Power 5 conferences or coaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freeman is now a graduate assistant for&nbsp;Ohio, on the bench in a suit and tie instead of a jersey and gym shorts. He can look up in the rafters and see "2010" hanging on the NCAA Tournament banner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the question remains: What if he missed?</p>
<p>"I just know the feeling and mood around our team, late, was really good," Holtmann said.&nbsp;"When you win a game in that fashion, or you beat your rival, there&rsquo;s no question that gives you a great deal of momentum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frankly, it isn't that much of a discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy will tell you no," Fuss said, laughing. "He will tell you the season would&rsquo;ve been over, we couldn&rsquo;t have done anything without him. (But)&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know how that would&rsquo;ve changed our seed. Do we end up getting the 10 seed? Go somewhere else?"</p>
<p>There might not have been a MAC title, or an upset of Georgetown and a <em>USA Today</em> cover if Freeman had missed that shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he didn't.</p>
