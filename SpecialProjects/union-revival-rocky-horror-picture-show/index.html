        <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or Sadie Lamparyk’s first year in <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show,</em> there is one part she is most excited for:</p>

        <p>“I’m really looking forward to being in my underwear up on stage in front of a bunch of people.”</p>

            <p>That is the thing about Rocky and the Lost Flamingo Theatre Company’s staging of it. The night is a group of sweaty people, decked out in glitter and lace, belting out the lyrics to “Time Warp.” Their corsets are tied, their thigh-highs are secure and red lipstick is carefully painted on their lips. And it is not just the cast — it is everyone. </p>

        <p>There are no expectations. There is not really a dress code. It is $5 at the door and a night in The Union Bar &amp; Grill, 18 W. Union St., with 300 newly-made friends. </p>
       

        <p>“It’s very liberating,” Sasha Gough, an Athens resident who plays Dr. Scott, said. “There’s nothing that you can’t do besides be an asshole. You can walk around half-naked and everyone is kind of OK with it. There’s no question.”</p>

        <p>The show is coming home to The Union after the fire on Union Street in November 2014 forced the show to relocate to Jackie O’s Pub &amp; Brewery for one year. </p>
        
        <p>The show is getting more notice nationally due to FOX’s upcoming remake, starring Laverne Cox, Victoria Justice and Ryan McCartan. It airs on Oct. 20, the same day LFC’s show begins. </p>

        <p>“I’m not worried it will affect our attendance or anything,” Kelly Bergenstein, a senior studying sociology pre-law and director of the show, said. “People can go watch it online the next day. Why would you not go support local art? Why would you not go see something that you won’t be able to replay the next day? Like, it’s not going to be on Netflix a few months from now. This is an experience, not just a show. And that’s what we market to people.”</p>

        <p>She said she will give the remake a chance at a later time. She will be focused that night on the show, which is based on a cult classic. Logan Amon, a junior studying child and family studies who is playing Dr. Frank-N-Furter, saw that movie for the first time after he had already landed the part.</p>

        <p>“I actually hadn’t seen the movie when I auditioned,” Amon said. “I didn’t tell them until we all did the cast viewing party. I was like, ‘Hey, I haven’t seen this.’”</p>

        <p>At first he thought it was “wildly inappropriate for no reason,” but now that he is in it, he understands it. </p>

        <p>And so do the people of Athens. With lines that span the block outside of The Union, Bergenstein knows that her work does not go unnoticed. And it will not for her final year.</p>

        <p>“Now we’re in our 15th year and it’s such a staple in fall Athens culture and you don’t want to be the person that messes that up,” Bergenstein said. “So, there was a lot of pressure when I first got started but now, it’s like it’s not so much about the performances. It’s not so much about the show or the movie or the music — it’s about the experience and if you get the experience right, that’s what matters and I realized that that’s what was happening.” </p>

                    We do a lot of weird shit together. We all do a lot of weird sexual stuff together because we have to because it’s in the show, so we automatically bond. But then, I just feel like we all spend so much time together that we all just have a mutual love for the show and that just kind of brings people together.<br><strong>What’s your favorite TV show?</strong><em>Shameless</em>. It is so good. I made my mom buy the DVDs even though it’s on Netflix now.

        <h2 class="subhed">THE PLOT:</h2>

        <p>Is known for being bizarre.</p>

        <p>Basically, engaged couple Brad Majors and Janet Weiss are stranded after their car breaks down. They seek refuge in the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite and mad scientist. They have a weird time meeting the cast of characters at the mansion, which include his servants and his own man-made man, Rocky Horror.</p>

        <p>The original movie was released in 1975 and was directed by Jim Sharman. Tim Curry played the original Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Susan Sarandon played Janet and Barry Bostwick played Brad.</p>

                    Third year in </em>Rocky<strong>Janet is:</strong>“Annoying. Uptight. … She’s so annoying. Impressionable.”<br><strong>How have you changed from being involved in Rocky?</strong>
                    So this is my third year and I think over the years I’ve just become a lot more comfortable with myself. Definitely baring almost everything on stage … it forces you to become comfortable. I’ve also just made some great connections. I’ve met so many different people, so many different kinds of people.<br><strong>What’s your favorite place to be at in Athens?</strong>Probably my bedroom or College Green.

        <h2 class="subhed">HOW IT WORKS:</h2>

        <p>The cast of LFC has been rehearsing since the beginning of the academic year. The original movie plays behind the cast, who acts out what is happening on screen. That means the cast rehearses every movement the original actors are doing to be able to mimic them spot-on.</p>

        <h2 class="subhed">DEFINITION OF A  ROCKY VIRGIN:</h2>
        <p>“A <em>Rocky</em> virgin is someone who has never seen a live showing of the movie. So sitting on your couch at home, watching the movie does not alleviate your virgin status. It does not disappear until you see it live and you’ve gone through the sacrifices — you’re still a virgin,” Kelly Bergenstein, the director, said.</p>

                <br><strong>Why should people come to the show?</strong>
                    For one night, you can do whatever the hell you want, not be judged for it, look like a total f--king fool and be as sexy as you want. So, why not come? <br><strong>What’s your favorite food? </strong>I like the tempura burrito at Fusion.

        <h2 class="subhed">THE CALLBACKS:</h2>

        <p><em>Rocky Horror </em>is all about rituals — one aspects being the callbacks, where audience members become part of the dialogue. </p>

        <p> “When you usually hear the word callback, it means in an audition, you’re being ‘called back’ to … (complete) another stage of the process,” Darragh Liaskos, who is the assistant director, said. “But in Rocky, there’s a line and then the audience ‘calls back’ onto stage what we’ve said.”</p>

        <p> The audience fills in natural pauses with phrases that make sense to the dialogue already happening — which can lead to a lot of shouting.</p>

        <p><strong><em>If it is your first </em></strong><strong>Rocky, </strong><strong><em>the cast has some things they would like you to know:</em></strong></p>

        <p>“You’re not going to understand it. Don’t try to understand it. Like, don’t try to gain meaning from this movie. There is none. But also, come with an open mind and (be) ready to have fun. Just really embrace it.”  <em>Tess Plona, who is playing Janet</em></p>

        <p>“Be a virgin. Embrace the virgin. Don’t say you’re not a virgin when you really are.” <em>Kate Keverline, who is playing Columbia</em></p>

        <p>&ldquo;Just come in with an open mind and an open wallet for the bar.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Jeralayne Ruiz, who is playing Magenta</em></p>

        <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell them anything because going to a <em>Rocky </em>show is 10 trillion times better when you have no idea what you&rsquo;re get into. That&rsquo;s how it was the first time I ever saw <em>Rocky</em> and it was so overwhelming so I would tell them nothing.&rdquo; &nbsp;&mdash; <em>Sarah DiFiore, who is in the Whorus</em></p>

                        <br><strong>What are you thoughts going into this year’s <em>Rocky</em>?</strong>
                    I feel really good about this year. I don’t know if it’s because it’s my fourth year involved or my third year in charge or the people — I don’t know. Maybe the stars and planets aligned. I just think we have the right people in the right place at the right time and now that The Union is back, it just truly feels like this is how I want to end my time at Ohio University is doing this, with these people, at this time. <br><strong>Who’s a role model in your life?</strong>I want to say every woman in my life is someone I look up to, but particularly my mom. We don’t have a terrible amount in common but I think the best parts about me came from watching her and just everything that she does I aspire to.

                <br><strong>What is the impact Rocky has on Athens?</strong>
                  I definitely think it’s brought a little bit of sexual fluidity and sexual freedom to campus … and it kind of takes aways the stigma of being sexual and just being free with your body. Because, a lot of times people are like, ‘Oh that’s just so slutty, I can’t even imagine being involved in something like that’ and you see us and we’re all like childhood majors and teachers and we’re just being free. <br><strong>Favorite place to get food Uptown? </strong>Salaam.

                   <br><strong>Why should people attend the show?</strong>
                       It’s very loose and very free. People can kind of do whatever they want with the character they’re playing. Year to year, each character is just a little bit different based on who’s playing it and how they’re doing it. <br><strong>If you could travel anywhere, where would you go?</strong>
                    This is probably pretty lame, but I think it’d be really cool to go to California and just see all the national parks and see the redwood forests.

I love that man. … It was so interesting and engaging.

                   Probably the connection that you make with the other people onstage.

                    I feel like, as a person, I’ve made a huge progression from who I was as a freshman doing Rocky to who I am now, and I attribute a lot of that to the environment that Rocky provides.

                        (Being in <em>Rocky</em> is) really fun.

                    It was the very first thing I did freshman year, basically. So it’s painted my entire college career, I’d say.

                   The show is so different and no one really understands it and I think you can just have a lot of fun with it. So, I tell all my friends about it who have never seen it before and they’re like, “This doesn’t make sense — why would we go to this?” But I think people are just attracted to it because it’s so different. People who come here to watch it and pay to see it, they get to be something they’re not for a night.<br><strong>What’s the first CD you ever owned? </strong>CDs weren’t huge, but I remember I went to buy an All Time Low CD. I don’t remember which album it was, but it’s definitely something All Time Low, which is hilarious.
