        <p>Over the summer, the Ohio University Board of Trustees welcomed a new member and approved resolutions related to the budget. Here is what you need to know to get caught up to speed for the academic year.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Nellis and Ruthie pay raise</h2></div>
        
        <p>At the Board of Trustees meeting in June, board members approved a resolution that gave both the president and first lady pay increases, effective July 1.</p>
        
        <p>President Duane Nellis received a 1.5 percent pay raise of $7,125 and a bonus of $71,250, which is 15 percent of his annual salary, while First Lady Ruthie Nellis received a pay increase of $525. </p>
        
        <p>The president’s <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/06/top-salaries-frank-solich-saul-phillips-ohio-university">annual salary</a> is $475,000, which is consistent with the university-wide raise pool for the year.</p>
        
        <p>“The terms of Dr. Nellis’ contract, including the housing allowance, reflect national trends in higher education executive compensation,” Board of Trustees Chair Dave Scholl said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>The Board’s resolution defined Nellis’ accomplishments, including his work on renewing a focus on financial sustainability, strategic pathways and plotting a new direction to make OU a leading institution in higher education.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Fiscal year 2019 budget approved</h2></div>
        
        <p>During the June meeting in Chillicothe, the board approved the university budget for fiscal year 2019.</p>
        
        <p>Total revenues are up $15.3 million from fiscal year 2018 at $811 million, while $770 million in expense allocations will in part go toward university employee compensation and interest on the university’s loans and debt.</p>
        
        <p>The university and the OU Foundation have $610 million in outstanding debt as of June 30, according to the Board’s budget memo; however, for the next four fiscal years, OU will pay off 11 percent of the principal debt portfolio, which is $64 million.</p>
        
        <p>The 2019 budget will use $17 million in reserves, which will cover capital improvements, a new regional campus strategy and funding of strategic priorities and programs.</p>
        
        <p>“We want to figure out how we can create a sustainable and more enhanced model for regional higher education as part of the system of Ohio University,” Nellis said at the June meeting.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Capital Improvement Plan updates</h2></div>
        
        <p>Updates to the Capital Improvement Plan were approved by the board in June. The total budget for those projects between fiscal years 2019 and 2024 is $78.9 million.</p>
        
        <p>The board approved several capital project budget updates, including the construction of several “prioritized” campus roads. <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/05/street-repairs-vendors-city-council">OU and the City of Athens are partnering to repave</a> sections of West Green Drive, South Green Drive, Race Street, Rufus Street and East Union Street at Jeff Hill by the end of September.</p>
        
        <p>That project will cost $584,000.</p>
        
        <p>The preliminary stage of the repairs are scheduled to be completed on Aug. 17, according to a university press release from the Office of Facilities Management and Safety.</p>
        
        <p>“We don’t want to interfere with any of the move-in activities or anything like that,” Associate Vice President for Architecture, Design and Construction Greg Robertson said.</p>
        
        <p>The repairs in August are intended to prepare the roadways for asphalt mill and overlay paving, which are scheduled to take place in September.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">New trustee</h2></div>
        
        <p>Eileen M. Sheil was <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/05/eileen-sheil-board-of-trustees-new-member-ohio-university">appointed as the newest member</a> of the OU Board of Trustees by Gov. John Kasich in May.</p>
        
        <p>Sheil works as the executive director of corporate communications at Cleveland Clinic, according to a previous <i>Post</i> report.</p>
        
        <p>With a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism from OU and 22 years of experience in communications, Sheil aims to give back to the university through the volunteer position.</p>
        
        <p>“I want to (help) the university be the best it can be and attract the best and brightest students,” she said.</p>
        
        <p>Sheil's daughter, Lauren, is a sophomore studying strategic communication at OU and a Post columnist.</p>
