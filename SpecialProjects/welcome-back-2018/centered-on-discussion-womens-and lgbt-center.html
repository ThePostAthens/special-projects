        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        
        <p>Throughout the academic year, there are plenty of campus center events, from demonstrations to film screenings to art exhibits, that students can participate in.</p>
        
        <p>The Ohio University LGBT Center and Women’s Center have tweaked this year’s event programming to add some surprises and keep fan favorites.</p>
        
        <p>Among the LGBT Center’s “rainbow antics,” it might be best known for ongoing series such as Dine-n-Discuss, Queer Hollywood, Self-Care with Pride and Transgressive TV, all of which are staying. A discussion series named Resetting Parental Controls will join the line-up.</p>
        
        <p>“We wanted to offer a discussion series where we can talk about what it means to come out, what it means to be out (and how to navigate relationships with family),” Delfin Bautista, director of OU’s LGBT Center, said.</p>
        
        <p>Bautista, who uses the lowercase spelling of their name, enjoys the LGBT Center’s ongoing series because of the opportunity it gives the center to receive feedback from participants and try new ideas later on.</p>
        
        <p>To add to the homecoming festivities, the LGBT Center will host a drag show in Baker Center Theater. The event will welcome drag queens, drag kings and anyone else who wants to perform in hopes that the performance can lift students’ spirits.</p>
        
        <p>“We do a lot of serious work, so the drag shows are opportunities to be silly, to have fun, to laugh and just engage in conversation in a very different way,” Bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>In honor of World Suicide Prevention Day, the LGBT Center will host an outdoor vigil for a student from Zane State College, other students who have died by suicide and those who are struggling. The semblance of solidarity aims to destigmatize conversation about mental health and when to ask for help, bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>The LGBT Center helps students feel comfortable bringing up any sensitive topic, bautista said. But when it comes to educating students, not everyone can learn the same way, so the center offers a range of activities to interest its visitors.</p>
        
        <p>“Sitting around, coloring Darth Vader heads in the colors of the different pride flags may seem silly, but it may create an opportunity for really intentional, transformative conversation more so than a speaker may be able to generate,” bautista said.</p>
        
        <p>Geneva Murray, director of the OU Women’s Center, said the center’s events get the most attendance when they are centered around stories of sexual assault survivors. One example, The Monument Quilt, an artistic display of red-themed clothes that tells 2,200 stories of sexual assault, was showcased in Peden Stadium last October. It had more than 1,000 visitors in a day.</p>
        
        <p>During the Fall Semester, the Women’s Center will bring another art exhibit to campus that focuses on sexual assault. The display titled “What Were You Wearing?” features outfits worn by survivors at the time of their assault. Dozens of clothing entries along with brief recountings of the experiences were submitted by survivors in the Athens area.</p>
        
        <p>Art can help someone process their emotions more than statistics, Murray said. “What Were You Wearing” makes the topic much more personal because viewers start to think about the people in their lives.</p>
        
        <p>“Sexual violence is everyone’s problem,” Murray said. “Not only do we want to debunk rape myths, but we want to show them that their stories matter.”</p>
        
        <p>Murray wanted the exhibit to be available for viewing during “the Red Zone,” the first few weeks of the academic year when students are most likely to fall victim to sexual assault, to educate students before any harm can be done. As part of the event, students can access resources to take further steps if they’ve been assaulted and they can anonymously ask questions about sexual assault to a panel of experts.</p>
        
        <p>On International Women’s Day, the Women’s Center has another art exhibit planned that involves forming a large structure out of pipes and drapes that people can wander through. In each section, they’ll find art detailing what it’s like to be a woman and experience of women in other countries.</p>
        
        <p>More details are available about “Love Yourself Week.” The festivities include video booth affirmations, scale smashing and yoga. The keynote speaker will be Janay Rice of  #WhyIStayed fame. Her husband, former Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice, punched her in an elevator and dragged her out unconscious. The #WhyIStayed movement wants more people to show empathy toward assault survivors and not judge their decision to stay with their partner. She’ll speak about her experiences and why we need a different approach to considering these tragic moments.</p>
        
        <p>Two of the Women’s Center’s recurring programs are continuing strong into this year. Thirsting for Knowledge Thursdays, a part of the Brown Bag Lunch series, allows people to discuss gender issues in a casual way. International Women’s Coffee Hour offers a time for people to mingle, practice languages, play games and listen to worldly music.</p>
