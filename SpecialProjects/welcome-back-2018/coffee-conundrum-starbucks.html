        <p>When students return to school in August, they will not be paying more for their cup of joe.</p>
        
        <p>Starbucks Coffee <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/06/07/starbucks-raises-coffee-prices-2018/">announced </a>in June that they will increase their prices anywhere from 10 to 20 cents, which is the third increase in three years.</p>
        
        <p>Ohio University will not be increasing prices on products, even though the school is part of a “We Proudly Serve” contract with the company at The Front Room Coffee House, Steam Station Café and Southside Espresso Bar.</p>
        
        <p>OU spokesman Dan Pittman said Starbucks does not determine OU campus cafe pricing structure, and that no immediate price increase is planned for any cafe that serves Starbucks products on campus. </p>
        
           <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/942e849f-7e1a-4f40-bfd8-24b3d5d1f666.sized-1000x1000.png" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Rilee Lockhart | ILLUSTRATION</p></div>
        
        <p>Josie Ehrman, an undecided sophomore, said she prefers local coffee shops because they usually have more interesting flavors.</p>
        
        <p>“Sometimes having the same caramel Frappuccino gets kinda boring,” Ehrman said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>She said that if prices did go up, she would not change her habits, as she views coffee as a luxury and only drinks it about once or twice a month.</p>
        
        <p>“I don’t think I would change my habits too much because I kinda think it is expensive,” Ehrman said. “I also don’t drink it too often, so the change in price wouldn’t really be breaking my bank.”</p>
        
        <p>Prestin Minter is an avid coffee drinker who drinks it at least three times a day.</p>
        
        <p>“If I’m on campus, like running around, Front Room would be the easiest because it’s in Baker,” Minter, a sophomore studying strategic communication, said. “But if I’m off campus, I like Brenan’s Coffee a lot.”</p>
        
        <p>Minter said because he often spends late nights in Alden or Front Room, OU-provided coffee is often his only choice.</p>
        
        <p>“If I had the option to go somewhere else and I had the time, I would go somewhere else,” he said.</p>
        
        <p>A full-service Starbucks is also <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/02/starbucks-athens-union-street-donkey-coffee">coming to Athens</a> at 16 W. Union St. this summer. Minter said he thinks it is annoying to raise prices since students will be coming to the new location.</p>
        
        <p>“I think Starbucks is doing it because they can do it and people are going to deal with it,” Minter said. “They’re such a big company, so they know they can do it and people will still drink their coffee.”</p>
        
        <p>Pittman also said the OU Culinary Services team is aware of Starbucks’ announcement to phase out plastic straws from all of its locations by 2020. They are assessing steps to do the same for OU coffee vendors, such as Front Room Coffeehouse and Southside Espresso Bar.</p>
