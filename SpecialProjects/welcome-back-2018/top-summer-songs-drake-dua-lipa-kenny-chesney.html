So if you’re headed back to classes or just want to remember the fleeting summer of 2018, here’s the songs you should listen to:</p>

        <div><h2 class="subhed">The one that was overplayed on the radio: “The Middle” - Zedd (feat. Maren Morris and Grey)</h2></div>

        <p>This summer was filled with tons of songs that Top 40s radio overplayed. However, out of all of those songs, Zedd’s “The Middle” takes the cake. The electro-pop song is infamous for being <a href="https://variety.com/2018/music/news/zedd-the-middle-singers-maren-morris-camila-cabello-demi-lovato-carly-rae-jepsen-1202778917/">cycled through 12 different singers</a> before it reached country music’s Maren Morris. Even though it was passed up by big wigs such as Demi Lovato and former Fifth Harmony member Camila Cabello, Morris brought something to the song that people and radio stations loved and relentlessly played over and over again.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The one that brought people together: “Get Along” - Kenny Chesney</h2></div>
        
        <p>Country music pioneer Kenny Chesney is no stranger to beachy-vibe summer songs, and “Get Along,” off of his newly released album Songs for the Saints, is no exception. Featuring a message of acceptance and respecting others, the song was played everywhere from on the lake to the simple neighborhood barbeque. It’s laid back, easy going and everything one would want in their summer.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The one that people hate to love and love to hate: “Havana” - Camila Cabello (feat. Young Thug)</h2></div>
        
        <p>Camila Cabello has had a booming solo career since she left Fifth Harmony in 2016. With the release of her debut album, Camila, Cabello was able to showcase just what she could do on her own, and the result was songs such as “Havana.” The song is equal parts Top 40s pop and Latin flare. It’s catchy, a bit repetitive and a song that people loved, then quickly hated due to its overplayed radio presence, but still secretly love. No matter if it was being played at a party or secretly sung in the shower, “Havana” definitely made a presence this summer.  </p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The one that helps people get over their summer flings: “IDGAF” - Dua Lipa </h2></div>
        
        <p>In 2017, Dua Lipa taught girls the rules to love, and in the summer of 2018 she taught them how to rid of creeping exes. The song stands as the seventh single off of her 2017 self-titled debut album, and it proves why Lipa has created such a name for herself in pop music. “IDGAF” is the perfect song to ward off any exes or summer flings, and it was most likely put to good use this summer.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The one that everyone undeniably loves: “In My Feelings” - Drake</h2></div>
        
        <p>This summer has been filled with hit after hit from Drake. Between songs such as “God’s Plan,” “Nice For What” and “In My Feelings;” it seems as if you can’t escape the rapper. Off of his newest album Scorpion, “In My Feelings” is catchy and easy to dance to. After listening to this song, one can’t help but wonder if Kiki loves Drake. Maybe KB does? All that’s certain is that everyone should love this song.</p>
