       t’s well-known that <a href="https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/qa/does-everyone-experience-stress">everyone endures stress</a> at some point in their life. While some people thrive with tension, others can’t help but feel overwhelmed and lose sight of what they want to accomplish—no matter what it is. If you’re a part of the latter and want to succeed in the classroom while still enjoying your time on campus, fear not. Here’s a thorough list on how to truly make these years of college worthwhile without completely stressing yourself out:



    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Make set studying times</h2></div>

        <p>At Bobcat Student Orientation, incoming freshmen are told, with a response of loud, involuntary gasps, they are expected to study for around 30 hours a week for their classes. That’s nearly impossible when you combine that with homework, projects, social time and self-care. Instead, set aside a couple hours a day to study for a particular class. The next day, do the same thing for another class. That way, you can concentrate on one subject a day, and it’ll add up to about 10 hours per week, which sounds a lot better than 30. Of course, you can add more hours if you have an upcoming exam you’re worried about in a particular class, and you can alter this plan however you need for the weekends.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Talk to your professor when you’re concerned</h2></div>
        <p>Everyone inevitably encounters a class in which they aren’t going to do as well as they would like. Professors set up office hours for this specific reason—so you can talk to them about it. Professors really aren’t as scary as they may seem, and they’ll immensely appreciate that you came to them for help rather than continue to struggle (and you eventually will, too). You’ll get some solid advice, and you’ll feel a lot better about the class. Plus, you could form a solid bond with the professor that may become handy in the future when you need references.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Join an extracurricular</h2></div>
        <p>One of the best ways to destress is by doing something you love, and this can be done by joining an extracurricular that pertains to your major, a club sport or one of the other hundreds of <a href="https://ohio.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations">student organizations</a> at Ohio University. What you join doesn’t have to be for professional enhancement. It can be solely recreational, like the Billiards Club, the OU Gaming Association or club soccer. However, if your joy comes from the career you’re pursuing and you want to do something connected with it, there are numerous organizations that coincide with majors, including the Biomedical Engineering Society and OU’s Society for Health Administration. You’re bound to find at least one organization you’ll love.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Practice self-care daily</h2></div>
        <p>An integral part of living a healthy lifestyle is by implementing self-care into each day. This can be as simple as setting aside time to just relax and do what you love, like reading a book or snacking while watching your favorite show for an hour. Another option is to explore, and attempt to find something new and exciting in Athens. You could go to a different historic location, like The Ridges or Bong Hill, each day. You could switch between a new adventure and doing something you know you love each day—whatever you want.</p>
        <p>It’s also crucial to take this time to focus on your mental health, verify you’re happy with how your life is going and never let anyone tell you it’s not OK to focus on your own personal needs sometimes. The root of success is in firmly believing in your ability to thrive, and this can begin by treating yourself correctly every day via self-care.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Remember to spend time with friends</h2></div>
        <p>The friends you make in college are said to be the best you’ll ever have, so don’t miss out. You have all the time in the world to work on your dreams and hone your craft, but you may not have much time with friends. Always try to make a buddy in each class, and create plans with them and other friends you make throughout your time in college, so you don’t spend all of your time studying and stressing. However, you can always study with friends to ease the strain. Open yourself up, meet new people and savor the moments with them during your short time in college because they’ll be over and you’ll be reminiscing before you know it.</p>
