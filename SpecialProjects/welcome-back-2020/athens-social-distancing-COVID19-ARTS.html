        thens has always prided itself on local businesses that are independent and creatively driven. COVID-19 has seriously impeded on their opportunities to connect with Ohio University students and the Athens residents. Despite the setback, notable and well-loved businesses are getting creative with how to connect to their audience – in a socially distant way.

        <p>The Dairy Barn Arts Center, located at 8000 Dairy Ln, has a multitude of exhibits and virtual workshops on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dairybarnartscenter/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
 

        <p>“We have an exhibition called Art of Our Appalachian Woods running from now until Sept. 6 that showcases art made out of wood from Appalachia,” Leah Magyary, the executive director of the Dairy Barn, said in an email.</p> 


        <p>According to the Dairy Barn’s website, the exhibition highlights artists and woodworkers in the southeastern Ohio region and displays an assortment of materials and techniques in woodworking. The exhibition consists of 29 individual artists and includes 70 art pieces.</p>
 

        <p>Because the Dairy Barn has a liquor license, Magyary also said that the Neon Cow patio bar is serving wine on Thursdays and Fridays from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., with reservations <a href="https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.signupgenius.com%2Fgo%2F10c0d4dacaf2da0f8cf8-artofour&data=02%7C01%7Ceg245916%40ohio.edu%7C18ae588d086047fd353908d834b1039c%7Cf3308007477c4a70888934611817c55a%7C0%7C0%7C637317282173998849&sdata=wrLrKdp64qkw8Mj%2FVixi1TT48p6xg961IhusAitGhvY%3D&reserved=0" target="_blank">required</a>.</p>
 

        <p>The Dairy Barn hosts a painting party online and in-person every Thursday. For online painting, the center asks for reservations ahead of time or the day of and customers can pick up materials with no contact. Reservations for materials must be made at least one week in advance of the desired date. </p>


        <p>For in-person painting, the center can accommodate as many as eight people and masks and social distancing guidelines are required. <a href="https://dairybarn.org/brushes-the-barn/" target="_blank">All materials will be provided, and packages are available</a> for varying prices.</p>
 

        <p>“We have worked really hard to keep as vibrant and present as possible throughout the pandemic,” Magyary said in an email. “Our facility was closed for a while due to the Shelter in Place order, so we switched to predominantly online programming for that period of time. Our <a href="https://dairybarn.org/oraandersontrail/" target="_blank">Ora Anderson hiking trail</a>, a 1-mile loop behind The Dairy Barn, has been a great way to keep the community involved, and the trail is nice and wide for social distancing.” </p>

        <p>Just down the road, ARTS/West, on 132 W. State St., is allowing people to view its monthly gallery shows by appointment.</p>
 

        <p>“We have a new show coming up in the month of August and that show is called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/724217811749974/" target="_blank">‘What Are You Looking At?’</a> and it's a photography show,” Emily Beveridge, program specialist for ARTS/West, said. “It’s a work of recent Athens High School graduate named Darian Knapp and that show will be up to the month of August by appointment.”</p>


        <p>ARTS/West, in theory, could have up to 10 people see a gallery showing at a time as long as they distance. However, small groups are better, Beveridge said. Face masks and social distance guidelines are required.</p>
 

        <p>Business for ARTS/West has changed.  </p>

        <p>“Well, the thing that's really changed the most for ARTS/West is that one of our primary services to the community is offering a venue for people to put on performances, or group gatherings,” Beveridge said. “Right now, there's really no guidelines issued by the state for how to safely put on shows where people actually come in as an audience. We may wind up hosting some performances here in the fall that are either filmed or live streamed, but those shows are still working out the details and it's up in the air as to whether or not that will actually move forward.”</p>

        <p>Not all hope is lost, however. ARTS/West will host a Zoom poetry reading on the third Thursday of the month in September, October and November with the state poet laureate, Kari Gunter-Seymour. The Zoom poetry reading is called “Spoken and Heard.”</p>

        <p>One town over in Nelsonville, Stuart’s Opera House, located at 52 Public Square, is also hosting virtual social distancing activities.</p>
 

        <p>Students can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYzE2PD1mW4u1H2qMFLNjTlU3C5ScbfhvT1J32Wj8vtO7lUA/viewform" target="_blank">register</a> for the Virtual Old Time Music Week on Aug. 17 through Aug. 21. The music week is a virtual opportunity to learn guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, bass and dulcimer.</p>
 

        <p>“We will also be offering a Virtual Visiting Artist Program, a series of master classes offered by BIPOC, LGTBQ+ and women teaching artists from all over the country that will be available through our website in September,” Emily Prince, the education director, said in an email.</p>
 

            <p>Prince said the opera house does not have any plans for any in-person classes for the foreseeable future.
