    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
    <p class="intro">
        <span>W</span>elcome back, astro-lovers. It’s your one and only source into what the stars have aligned for you in Athens this upcoming year. The bricks are calling your name, but are other unwanted totalities begging for your attention, too? 
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Remember, your mind, body and soul can only handle so much. Let your horoscope for this upcoming fall semester help guide what and who you put your energy towards and how you divide your time.</p>
        <p>This semester, the third Mercury retrograde of 2022 will occur on Friday, Sept. 9 in Libra, then enter Virgo on Friday, Sept. 23. This will then go direct on Sunday, Oct. 2. You may see a return of past lovers, but try not to gravitate toward any toxicity the retrograde may incite.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Aries (March 21-April 19)</h2></div>
        <p>Lucky planet Jupiter entered your sign on Tuesday, May 10, and it will stay there until Friday, Oct. 28. During this period in Jupiter, take your academics seriously. You’re feeling more easily enriched, which is convenient given that new classes can always be tricky. Keep your ambitions on the horizon; the upcoming months may be the ideal time to pursue them.</p>
        <p>As for your love life, keep Sunday, Oct. 9 in mind. That night, there will be a full moon in your sign, and shall we say, things could escalate with a romantic interest of yours if the two of you find yourselves together. Take advantage of this because when Mars retrograde begins on Sunday, Oct. 30, your feelings for a person may be subliminal at best.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Taurus (April 20-May 20)</h2></div>
        <p>Taurus, you’ve been feeling empowered lately due to fighter planet Mars in Taurus. It will stay through Saturday, Aug. 20, so do what you may with the little time left sitting in this energy. We recommend taking control of a situation that has been taking precedence when it shouldn’t.</p>
        <p>Following Aug. 20, be on the lookout for a full moon and total lunar eclipse in your sign on Tuesday, Nov. 8. You’ll experience a shift in energy as any lingering emotional distress will lift itself as a burden in your life.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Gemini (May 21-June 21)</h2></div>
        <p>You’ve been on a roll lately and you know it. The best part is that momentum isn’t stopping any time soon. Warrior Mars will leave Taurus and enter your sign, meaning your confidence will skyrocket even more than it already has in all aspects of your life, including your career.</p>
        <p>Continue to channel this energy, though. From Friday, Sept. 9 to Sunday, Oct. 2, Mercury Retrograde will hit, and it hits Geminis even harder. Life will move quickly, so stay on top of your responsibilities while soaking in every day of the fall season. Especially senior Geminis, it’ll be your last one in Athens, so make it count.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Cancer (June 22-July 22)</h2></div>
        <p>Dear Cancer, we know you’re sad the summer months have come to an end. After all, it is your season. But don’t get too down about it. The semester has some worthwhile stuff in store for you, too.</p>
        <p>But first, you need to be mindful of what is happening currently as you are experiencing Neptune retrograde. You will be in this state until Sunday, Dec.3, so figure out what works for you in terms of who you are allowing to be in the limelight of your life.</p>
        <p>During this retrograde, we can often lose sight of who and what is important, so instead of succumbing to toxicity, reflect on what it is you want from life and from a partner. It’s best to be aware now. A messy full moon and lunar eclipse enters Taurus on Wednesday, Nov. 8; you aren’t going to want to start something new with someone, as it could potentially bring unwarranted drama into your life.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)</h2></div>
        <p>Ceres, an asteroid representing our caring and nurturing sides, remains in Leo until Thursday, Sept. 29. Until then, look toward helping others and giving back. No part of you will regret it. </p>
        <p>Venus also enters your sign on Thursday, Aug. 11. This is the time to manifest your future with a certain someone and put plans into motion. Sit in the driver’s seat and prepare for a romantic culmination.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)</h2></div>
        <p>Are you sensing yourself healing, Virgo?</p>
        <p>We hope so. Mercury has been working in your sign and soon, the sun will too. The sun enters your sign on Monday, Aug.22, ultimately signifying the era of you. Whatever it is you want, you get. We don’t make the rules! The stars do.</p>
        <p>With that being said, seriously, please put yourself first. Saturday, Aug. 27 sees a new moon in Virgo -- primarily a time to invest in yourself.</p>
        <p>This self-love period is necessary because you will meet Venus on Monday, Sept. 5 through Thursday, Sept. 29. This is an ideal time for first dates, experimentation and pleasure. And everyone knows, you can’t love someone else until you love yourself.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 23)</h2></div>
        <p>Communication is key! Starting Thursday, Aug. 25, Mercury enters Libra through Saturday, Oct. 29.</p>
        <p>Simply put, say what you want to say during this time. Conversations will happen naturally and thoughts and opinions will be reciprocated. All of this will help you gain the clarity you’ve wished for.</p>
        <p>And don’t think we forgot that Libras are celebrating a birthday this fall! The sun enters Libra on Thursday, Sept. 22, which means life will unfold in your favor.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Scorpio (Oct. 24-Nov. 21)</h2></div>
        <p>Oh, Scorpio, when will you ever learn to put your temper behind you?</p>
        <p>It’s no secret that Mercury retrogrades don’t come easy to you. The final one of this year occurs from Monday, Sept. 27 to Monday, Oct. 18.</p>
        <p>You may feel pulled to succumb to old habits. To avoid this, try and look for and practice a healthy way to hone in on your desires.</p>
        <p>Once the retrograde ends, your season is behind on Saturday, Oct. 23, and from there, it’s smooth sailing. Your stingy, stubborn personality is built for Halloween, so celebrate and dress for the holiday accordingly, as it is sure to boast new memories.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)</h2></div>
        <p>Sagittarius, boy are you lucky. The astro-gods are calling for fun at the beginning of the semester, and odds are, you are already having some.</p>
        <p>Jupiter, your ruling planet, goes retrograde on Thursday, July 28 where it stays until Wednesday, Nov. 23. This means you should say yes to every social activity and opportunity and prioritize your friends over lovers.</p>
        <p>Besides, once Venus enters your sign on Wednesday, Nov. 16 until Friday, Dec. 9, you’ll have plenty of time to daydream about relationships -- both new and old ones.</p>
        <p>By contemplating each’s current state, you can decide which is serving you and your romantic needs more than the other.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)</h2></div>
        <p>Oh, you workaholic. Naturally, the strict Saturn is your ruling planet and boy does it have plans for you. It will be in retrograde through Sunday, Oct. 23, meaning it is a fitting time to get your ducks in a row: apply for jobs, internships, begin a new project, etc. Simply put, take time to practice the thing it is you do best, Capricorn: work.</p>
        <p>Because you prioritize work over love, don’t expect a romantic interest to come into your life and stay until Mercury enters Capricorn on Tuesday, Dec.6, making communication clearer.</p>
        <p>Come time for Friday, Dec. 9, when Venus enters your sign, things could shift romantically for you too.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)</h2></div>
        <p>You may think this fall will be mundane for you, Aquarius, but we’re here to tell you it will be anything but that.</p>
        <p>Your ruling planet, Uranus goes into retrograde on Wednesday, Aug. 24, where it will stay for a long time…more specifically, until Sunday, Jan. 22.</p>
        <p>You often come across as guarded, but throughout the next couple of months, don’t be hesitant to let those walls down. Everyone knows you have the ability to flourish, it’s just been a matter of when you’re going to prove it to yourself.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)</h2></div>
        <p>You’re in a slump, Pisces, and you need relief from it. Neptune retrograde is in effect until Saturday, Dec. 3, meaning this is the energy you need to pull you out of that rut. </p>
        <p>Do so before a full moon in Pisces occurs on Saturday, Sept. 10, and the odds for successful manifestation is more likely. If you know what you want beforehand, you’ll feel more prepared for the next coming months and some potential life changes.</p>
