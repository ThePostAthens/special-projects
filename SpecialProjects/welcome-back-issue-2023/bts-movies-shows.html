    <p class="intro">
        <span>A</span>s the end of August quickly approaches, one can’t help but get a little anxious before the school year starts. With various convenience stores gutted from back-to-school shopping and professors slowly starting to send out syllabi, you might find yourself searching for a medium to project your worries onto.

    <div class="content">
        <p>Luckily, there are plenty of back-to-school movies and shows for one to watch before school really is back in session. Here are some of the best back-to-school movies and shows:        </p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>‘The Breakfast Club’  </i>       </h2></div>
        <p>If you haven’t seen this cult classic, then it’s time you watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSXBvor47Zs">“The Breakfast Club.”</a>. Starring Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and Emilio Estevez, the film follows five high school students from different social groups during their high school detention. Supervised by their power-hungry principal, each student ends up bonding with one another, sharing their individual stories that prove you can make lasting connections with strangers. Like the movie, college is very similar, as you’re forced to meet new people within your first few weeks of classes or you have to rebuild a friend group from the year before. Overall, it’s a good movie to watch if you’re feeling a little lost before the school year starts. It’s the perfect mix of comedy and drama to keep you engaged the whole time.        </p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>‘Sex Education’        </i>       </h2></div>
        <p>After making its debut on Netflix back in 2019, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AvRuvPaumw">“Sex Education”</a> has become one of the streaming service’s best shows because of its heartfelt themes and relatable content. With each season starting off with a new school year, it’s ideal to watch at the start of the school year. From tackling the awkwardness of sex, identity and relationships, this show helps one feel more at ease about themselves, while also allowing for laughter and major plot twists. Starring Asa Butterfield, Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa, this series details how the “outcasts” can become everyday heroes, as well as connect with people from all different backgrounds much easier than the status quo.        </p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>‘Pitch Perfect’        </i>       </h2></div>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9YewJWcZyc">“Pitch Perfect”</a> is another movie that will instantly lift your spirits, as its early 2010s humor is relatable for this generation of college students. With its star-studded cast, you can’t help but find yourself singing along with The Barden Bellas as they navigate a new school year in the world of collegiate acapella. Focused on one particular newcomer to college, viewers watch as, Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, comes out of her shell as she ventures into the unknown after auditioning for The Barden Bellas. Making new and unexpected friendships, as well as getting herself into a friends-to-lovers trope, this movie has some of the best lines and scenes in recent comedy films. Unlike “The Breakfast Club,” which this movie actually mentions, “Pitch Perfect” is more for those who need a good laugh, and also love early 2000s music.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>‘Glee’   </i>       </h2></div>
        <p>Similar to “Pitch Perfect,” almost anyone can watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sefQqCMusJI">“Glee”</a> and find something relatable and funny from it. Set at McKinley High School in Ohio, teacher Mr. Schuester, played by Matthew Morrison, strives to start a new glee club. Recruiting an array of characters such as Lea Michele’s Rachel Berry and Cory Monteith’s Finn Hudson, everyone ends up knowing who the glee club is, causing drama left and right from their school’s cheerleading coach, Sue Sylvester, played by Jane Lynch. With many seasons, this show is great to watch if you’re looking for under 30-minute episodes. Also, if you love musical theater, this show is a must-watch, as most episodes consist of singing battles and intricate dance numbers. </p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><i>‘Juno’   </i>       </h2></div>
        <p>A movie revolving around a teenage girl named Juno who discovers she’s pregnant her senior year of high school, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0SKf0K3bxg">“Juno”</a> proves to viewers that one can make the best out of any situation, even if it is as terrifying as teen pregnancy. Juno, played by Elliot Page, decides to give her baby up for adoption to a hopeful couple but changes her mind when she realizes the husband has feelings for her. With the newfound knowledge she will become a mother, Juno takes viewers on a journey of self-acceptance, realizing that her pregnancy is not necessarily something to be frowned upon, but an event that may just help her find who she is. This movie is emotional and raw, making it a more serious watch, but it’s key to watch if you need reassurance and a sense of companionship before the school year starts. Michael Cera also makes an appearance, and who doesn’t love that?        </p>
