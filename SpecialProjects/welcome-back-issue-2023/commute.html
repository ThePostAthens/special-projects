    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
    <p class="intro">
        <span>W</span>ith the Fall Semester starting up, I’ve noticed a rise in back-to-school content on TikTok and other social media platforms. This content includes tips, tricks, and general advice for upcoming and current college students. I also quickly noticed that the content was geared toward those living in dorms, from dorm essentials to tips on getting along with your roommate. The content was abundant, but I didn’t see this same abundance of tips for commuters. 
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I commuted my entire freshman year, and I fully intend to for the rest of my college experience. When I first started school, I felt a bit lost. I’d heard all the standard tips and advice you hear when going to college, but I didn't hear a lot of tips specifically targeted at commuters. Whether your commute is an hour or five minutes, commuting is a unique experience that deserves more attention. During my first year at Ohio University, I picked up some tips that could be beneficial for other commuters to know.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Be aware of all parking options</h2></div>
        <p>I remember the stress of my first official day driving to campus. I was terrified that I would be scrambling to find a parking spot, I even came almost an hour early just in case. I quickly realized that finding parking wasn’t the horrible experience I expected. </p>
        <p>While some parts are more crowded than others, there are many readily available parking spots for the purple commuter passes. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ohio.edu/transportation-parking/map">parking map</a> can be easily accessed on Ohio University’s website. Make sure you’re aware of all parking options, it makes commuting a lot easier.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Utilize buildings on campus</h2></div>
        <p>The library is a place that I utilize every single day on campus. Since I don't have a dorm to go to after class, I often retreat to the peaceful atmosphere of Alden Library. Ohio University also offers a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ohio.edu/housing/commuter-lounge">commuter lounge</a> for commuter students to enjoy. All these buildings are excellent resources to use when you need a cozy study spot or a place to just relax between classes. .</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Give yourself enough time</h2></div>
        <p>When your classes aren't a ten-minute walk away, giving yourself enough time is essential. I live about 30 minutes away from campus so I always have to leave earlier. It is also essential to factor in walk times. It takes me about 10 minutes to walk to class from my parking spot, so I’m sure to always configure that when thinking about what time I have to leave in the morning. Depending on where you are coming from, traffic can be an important factor. </p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Get involved as much as you can</h2></div>
        <p>I know firsthand how difficult it can be to get involved in on-campus activities. It can feel like you're on campus all day, and it's hard to find time for clubs and activities when juggling everything else. I struggled with the massive gaps between classes and club activities. It's a challenge, but it's important to get involved in at least one thing. When I joined The Post, it was a perfect opportunity for me since it worked well with my busy schedule. If you can't find the time, don’t beat yourself up over it. It’s difficult, and if it takes you more time to join something, don’t sweat it. You have time!</p>
        <p>I’ve learned a lot from commuting my first year. However, one of the most important things I’ve learned is that everyone's college experience looks different. Whether you are living in the dorms or commuting for all four years, your college experience will differ dramatically from someone else's. Everyone goes at their own pace and experiences things differently. Your college experience is unique to you and you should cherish it.</p>
