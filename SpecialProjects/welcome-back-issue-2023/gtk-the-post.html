    <!-- INTRO (FIRST GRAF OF STORY - remove if design choices call for it) -->
    <p class="intro">
        <span>A</span>t Ohio University, there’s arguably only one student-run newspaper that trumps all on campus, and of course, it’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/"><i>The Post</i></a>. With over nine sections, a highly popular website and a bustling newsroom on the third floor of Baker Center, <i>The Post</i> is an opportunity for all students to get involved at OU, whether they’re pursuing journalism or not.
        Here’s a get-to-know guide to each section of <i>The Post</i> at Ohio University:
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <div><h2 class="subhed">News</h2></div> 
        <p>Led by News Editor Madalyn Blair and Assistant Editor Donovan Hunt, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/section/news">news</a> section is the perfect place for writers who want to cover breaking news in Athens and Southeast Ohio. From crime to politics, there’s always a story for someone to write, giving students ample opportunity to pick up a story each week. If you’re a fan of straightforward news content, then you should definitely look into joining this section. Also, the news staff is extremely timely and well-organized, another advantage of being a part of this section at <i>The Post</i>.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Sports</h2></div> 
        <p>Just as the section suggests, you will be writing about all things sports, on and off campus, if you join the sports section. With a wide array of sports to choose from, like football or women’s basketball, you won’t run out of events to cover or report on. This is also a great way for those who may not be a journalism major to join an organization because of its sports coverage, as many tend to have a passion for the topic. With Sports Editors Bobby Gorbett and Bobby Keegan, you’ll be in good hands throughout the year, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/section/sports">this section</a> brings the energy and excitement back into sports coverage.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Culture</h2></div> 
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/section/culture">Culture</a> is the ideal section for those who are interested in the local community and arts found in Southeast Ohio. Led by Culture Editor Alyssa Cruz and Assistant Editor Abby Jenkins, this section can always be seen laughing and conversing in the newsroom before meetings, knowing how to bring the fun to their weekly content. From covering dance recitals to interviewing university faculty, there’s always something new to write about in culture, as well as someone new to talk to. With a laid-back nature hard to find sometimes in other organizations, this section is usually a student favorite every year.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Opinion</h2></div> 
        <p>If you tend to hold a lot of opinions, then you should definitely join the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/section/opinion">Opinion</a> section at <i>The Post</i>. With writers having the ability to choose a topic of their own each week, this section is always trending online for its creativity and high-quality writing. Students can submit columns and editorials, and the freedom you get in this section is hard to find in other places. With the help of Editor Tate Raub and Assistant Editor Meg Diehl, your voice will grow and explore new topics, all while educating readers in and outside of Athens.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">The Beat</h2></div> 
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/section/the-beat">The Beat</a> is all things entertainment, so if that’s your favorite outlet to write about, then you need to join this section immediately. Students can write about music, film, pop culture or even celebrity breaking news, which makes this section extremely flexible and trendy. Led by Editor Grace Brezine and Assistant Editor Grace Koennecke, yours truly, The Beat never receives a bad story idea when it comes to the entertainment world. With many of the section’s stories gaining traction online each week, there’s no doubt this section is a standout within The Post.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Projects</h2></div> 
        <p>While many may think <i>The Post</i> just promotes shorter articles, there’s actually a section that is always in need of long-form reporting. <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.thepostathens.com/SpecialProjects/">Projects</a>, led by Editor Hannah Campbell and Assistant Editor Alex Imwalle, focuses on investigative pieces as well as multi-layered stories to publish for <i>The Post</i>. Usually requiring more interviews and writing, this section is the one to become a member of if you find yourself always in a constant state of research or curiosity. It’s also great for students who love talking to people, as well as can’t seem to put their pen down. If interested, read more past works from projects <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.thepostathens.com/SpecialProjects/">here</a>.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Copy and art</h2></div> 
        <p>Many non-journalism majors venture to the copy section, especially if one is interested in going into editing in the future. In copy, you are tasked with editing stories for the online version of <i>The Post</i> on a daily basis, checking for AP Style Guide errors and fact-checking content provided by writers. Led by Copy Chief Addie Hedges and multiple slot editors, this section prioritizes accuracy and efficiency every single day at <i>The Post</i>. Meanwhile, the art team suits those who genuinely love the medium. Led by Art Director Abbie Kinney and Assistant Art Director Emma McAdams, those in art can help create visuals for each section of <i>The Post</i> to go along with stories.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Photo</h2></div> 
        <p>Photojournalism is another unique aspect of <i>The Post</i>, as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/gallery">photo</a> section can always be seen running around campus to get the perfect shot for a certain story. Led by Director of Photography Alaina Dackermann and Photo Editor Zoe Cranfill, this section is for those who need a creative outlet beyond writing, as well as for those who like to stay busy. Working closely with other sections, photo is a fun way to get more involved on campus and in the newsroom.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Multimedia</h2></div> 
        <p>For some, writing is not nearly as interesting as creating audio and visual content, which leads one to join Multimedia. Multimedia provides all of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/gallery">podcasts</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepostathens.com/gallery">videos</a> for <i>The Post</i>, allowing students to create their own content to publish on a weekly basis without any restraints. Led by Director of Multimedia Cole Patterson and Assistant Director Kendall Timms, this section is definitely the most chaotic and carefree, with all of their works extremely memorable and relatable for students on campus.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Audience Engagement</h2></div> 
        <p>Lastly, audience engagement is a section meant for those who like working on social media projects. Led by Logan Jefferies, this section helps out with everything from <i>The Post's</i> nightly Instagram-scheduled posts to live-tweeting breaking news or sports events. This section is one for those who see a career in marketing, PR or social media. It’s also not an extreme time commitment or exhausting, which is nice for students with packed schedules. It’s an easy way to get involved with <i>The Post</i> and it teaches students how to engage with social media users and readers.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Last but not least, the main editors</h2></div> 
        <p>Most importantly, <i>The Post</i> wouldn’t be able to function without the top dogs, including Editor-in-Chief Katie Millard, Managing Editor Emma Erion, Digital Director Anastasia Carter and Equity Director Alesha Davis. If you want to eventually help run every aspect of the publication, one of these positions is perfect for you. With these roles, you are responsible for very important tasks such as making sure issues of <i>The Post</i> are published promptly to running Election Night in the newsroom. Overall, these leadership roles are the most respected in the organization, and everyone is always in touch with one of these individuals.</p>
