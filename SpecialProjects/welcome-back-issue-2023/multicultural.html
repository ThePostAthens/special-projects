    <p class="intro">
        <span>T</span>he multicultural community at Ohio University is rich with excellence, creativity and tradition. One of those long-standing traditions is the Multicultural Exposition.
    </p>

    <!-- CONTENT GOES HERE -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>The expo allows multicultural organizations to come together for the first time during the new academic year to showcase the support and community offered at OU for minority students.</p>
        <p>“The most important factor that I think can be seen throughout all of Ohio’s multicultural organizations is the sense of belonging that students get when being around the members of these organizations,” Joi Foy, a junior studying journalism, said.</p>
        <p>The expo is hosted by the Black Student Union, or BSU, and will be held this year on Aug. 30 from 6-9 p.m. in Baker Ballroom.</p>
        <p>“There will be so many different opportunities to connect with people,” Trinity Robinson, a junior studying business, said. “Even outside of learning about organizations, you'll be able to connect with new people and make new friends.”</p>
        <p>Robinson is the president of BSU, a LINKS peer mentor, a College of Business ambassador and previously served as treasurer for OU’s Student Senate, but her work with BSU is especially important to her.</p>
        <p>“The space overall has become a home for me, especially the people in the org themselves,” Robinson said.</p>
        <p>BSU will host several events throughout the year, but the expo is the kickoff to a year of extensive programming.</p>
        <p>The event features informative tables, performances and food and is somewhat similar to the involvement fair, but with a more concentrated goal.</p>
        <p>“It gives especially the new Black kids in school, whether they're transfer students or freshmen, it gives them a place to find people that look like them," J. Pressley Mcilwain, a sophomore studying psychology and communications, said.</p>
        <p>Organizations such as FACES modeling, the Divine 9 and Athens Black Contemporary Dancers will perform during the expo.</p>
        <p>“I was coming in cold from across the country, I didn’t know anybody, and FACES was one of the first organizations to really take me under their wing,” Mcilwain said.</p>
        <p>Mcilwain is now the vice president of FACES Modeling and has been working on its expo performance over the summer.</p>
        <p>“I feel like you could expect a new flair on FACES,” Mcilwain said.</p>
        <p>Mcilwain is also a general body member of the Ohio University Recruiting Society, or OURS, an organization that focuses on multicultural recruitment and retention.</p>
        <p>“They make an effort to really connect with the underclassmen that may have a hard time making friends with other people,” Mcilwain said. “They really want to build a community within their group, so I applaud that.”</p>
        <p>FACES, OURS and BSU are only a few of the student organizations for multicultural Bobcats at the university. Other organizations geared toward different backgrounds, such as the Latino Student Union and the Asian American/Pacific Islander Student Union, will be present for students to check out.</p>
        <p>Foy holds a plethora of leadership roles within the community, serving as the president of the Black Student Communication Caucus and the Multicultural Sports Organization Professionals and co-president of Ebony Minds.</p>
        <p>“The main impact I hope incoming students see through my leadership is that they can do this too and also that they have support at Ohio,” Foy said.</p>
        <p>Ebony Minds, which is dedicated to education on the struggles of African-American women, is an organization dear to Foy’s heart.</p>
        <p>“The women of the organization, those that have graduated and are still in the organization have become my family and made my transition to college so smooth,” Foy said.</p>
        <p>All in all, many of OU’s multicultural students have found their home away from home in these organizations, and they hope you join their families this year.</p>
        <p>“We welcome everybody, we want everybody to come,” Robinson said.</p>
