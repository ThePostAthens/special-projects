        <p>To Becky Rondy, 2018 was Green Edge Organic Gardens’ worst year of growing to date.</p>
        
        <p>“My husband is fond of the saying, ‘A dry year will scare a man to death, but a wet one will make him go hungry,’” Rondy said.</p>
        
        <p>Many Athens County farms experienced an overall poor year in the growing of their produce. The immense amounts of rain and flooding made the job of tending to farms more challenging, keeping farmers from growing as much as in past years.</p>
        
        <p>Green Edge Organic Gardens primarily grows year-round salad mix, microgreens, mushrooms and assorted seasonal produce. At Rondy’s farm in Amesville, produce is grown in 10 high tunnels during the summer and winter seasons. A building especially set aside houses the micrograins, and another room has been converted for mushrooms.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately for Rondy, her farm did not produce as well as it has in the past.</p>
        
        <p>“The year was bad mainly because of the weather. It was too wet, too cold, and there was tons of flooding,” Rondy said. “Each farm is different, but it has been a challenging year for all of us.”</p>
        
        <p>Since the weather has been so poor, Green Edge Organic Gardens’ sales at the Athens Farmers Market have been weaker, but Rondy has started preparations for the winter season and has higher hopes for the crop that will be produced.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/80cca3cb-0787-4ddb-a63f-e70ce3a97130.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">McKinley Law | PHOTO EDITOR</p><p class="pcut">Owner of Cherry Orchards, Neil Cherry sells his produce at the Athens County Farmer’s Market on Wednesday. </p> </div>
        <br>
        
        <p>“High tunnels are planted with winter greens and vegetables, and they’re coming along nicely,” Rondy said. “The winter quite possibly will be better than what the year has brought so far because everything is grown under cover.”</p>
        
        <p>In the winter, Rondy is able to better control the elements that might otherwise damage the produce.</p>
        
        <p>“We’ve been doing this seasonal creation where we grow and harvest in the winter without heat,” Rondy said. “We have full-sized greenhouses that capture quite a lot of geothermal heat throughout the day.”</p>
        
        
        <p>Ronda Clark and her farm had just about the same amount of luck as Rondy’s did this past year. Blackberry Sage Farm grows all sorts of produce on at least half of its 59-acre farm, including blackberries, rhubarb, gooseberries, green beans, tomatoes and squash.</p>
        
        <p>“It was a hard year with too much rain and flooding,” Clark said. “I also got sick, which didn’t help with all the crop loss either.”</p>
        
        <p>Clark doesn’t do much farming during the spring and fall seasons because she homeschools her children, but she gets a lot done during the winter.</p>
        
        <p>“I’ve planted everything for the winter season and won’t start again until April,” Clark said. “I think the expectations for the winter season are better, partly because I’m also feeling better, but also because we’ve transformed our garden into tree crops, like mulberries and apples, so hopefully we won’t get flooded and lose our annual crops again.”</p>
        
        <p>Despite the hardships the growing year brought on Clark and her farm, Blackberry Sage Farm has still been able to sell its produce at the Athens Farmers Market without much problem.</p>
        
        <p>“We always sell. People come out regardless of weather and buy our food,” Clark said.</p>
        
        <p>“I don’t really feel in competition with other vegetable growers either because most or all of our stuff sells really well.”</p>
        
        <p>The poor weather also affected Homecoming Farm LLC, another Athens Farmers Market vendor.</p>
        
        <p>Homecoming Farm LLC produces fresh fruits and vegetables, mainly a lot of berries that John Wood plants himself in the farm’s small field.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/5195305b-b2f9-4d95-a758-8784e8450641.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">McKinley Law | PHOTO EDITOR</p><p class="pcut">Cherry Orchards farm located in Crooksville, Ohio sells fresh produce at the Athens County Farmer’s Market on Nov. 28, 2018.</p> </div>
        <br> 
        
        <p>Wood acknowledges that every farmer’s year regarding growing is different depending on what the product is and where one’s farm is located.</p>
        
        <p>“If you’re down in the river bottoms and had sandy soils, all the rain we got might have not been a problem, but if you’re up in the hills in all the clay, you probably had water-logged soils,” Wood said.</p>
        
        <p>Wood’s farm also had a very challenging year due to the excessive amount of rainfall, causing a 20 percent reduction in the farm’s productivity for the year.</p>
        
        <p>“I believe we had 10 inches over the average of rain we usually get, which I think is 35 inches,” Wood said. “We lost a lot of crops to wet soil, rot and weeds.”</p>
        
        <p>Homecoming Farm LLC may be done planting for the year, but Wood expects the weather patterns to remain unpredictable as he gets ready for the next year.</p>
        
        <p>“The last five years have been some of the wettest and most dry years, making it hard for someone in agriculture to prepare for the upcoming growing seasons,” Wood said. “We’re limiting our scope to more perennial plants that tend to hold up better to some of the conditions we’re seeing, as well as removed some of our vegetable gardens where we planted some more hardy perennials.”</p>
        
        <p>Although Homecoming Farm LLC’s sales have been lower than usual at the Athens Farmers Market, customers are still able to find everything they need.</p>
        
        <p>“I don’t want to give the impression there’s a significant shortage and that people should be going to Kroger first, because there’s still an abundance of food produced here.”</p>
        
        <p>Wood sees the food systems around this area to be quite amazing, no matter what type of year it was for growing.</p>
        
        <p>“Even in hard years we’re still producing a lot, and customers should expect to go to the market and find what they’re after,” Wood said.</p>
