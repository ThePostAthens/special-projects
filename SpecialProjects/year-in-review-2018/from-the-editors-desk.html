        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>Congratulations! You’ve nearly made it to the end of Fall Semester. Finals week may be looming, but soon students can look forward to a little bit of R&R at home, while Athens residents can perhaps look forward to a few weeks of relative peace and quiet.</p>
        
        <p>This is the first time we can recall doing this kind of “year in review” issue. Since we made the transition to a weekly print publication in 2016, we’ve been closing out the semester with “Post Picks,” a special “best-of” issue that showcased a few of Athens’ favorite people, places and things.</p>
        
        <p>This time around, however, we chose to reflect on the year 2018 as a whole, highlighting both the moments that brought us together and the times that tested the forces that hold us together.</p>
        
        <p>I’m not surprising anyone by saying the national headlines have been bleak this year. Between school shootings, devastating natural disasters, tumultuous politics and horrible acts of violence, we all might be feeling a bit too much of the anxiety-inducing weight of the world we’re living in. However, in the midst of the chaos, we may be able to find a few glimmers of hope.</p>
        
        <p>In the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, the March for Our Lives was born, prompting young people across the nation to advocate for stronger gun control laws. The midterm elections, while extremely divisive, yielded the most diverse set of representatives in American history.</p>
        
        <p>In the months leading up to the election, students from both poles of the political spectrum sacrificed their time and sleep to knock on doors, work the phone lines and ensure that their classmates were registered to vote. Voter turnout in Athens County increased by 13 percent this year, and students took to social media to showcase their “I Voted” stickers with pride. </p>
        
        <p>On campus, when police began receiving reports of sexual assault at an alarming rate, students decided that this time around, enough was enough. They started GroupMe chats to make sure classmates had a safe way to walk home at night, and they took to the streets to protest in droves, giving impassioned, often deeply personal testimonies.</p>
        
        <p>We promise this issue isn’t all about the heavy stuff. Our blogs team, for instance, took a second look at the best movies, albums, songs, memes, concerts and more that 2018 had to offer. Our culture staff chatted with local artists about how they’ve seen their work evolve over the year, and checked in with local farmers about this year’s harvest. </p>
        
        <p>We’re glad we could bring you the headlines that mattered this year, and we hope that you’ll stick with <i>The Post</i> next year, no matter what it may bring. </p>
