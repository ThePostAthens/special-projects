        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>Now that we’ve hit December, the flood of each media outlet’s “Top 10 whatevers of 2018” are rapidly approaching. These are always fun to look at, true. Seeing what albums/movies/shows/songs/trends are generally agreed upon by everyone is what solidifies this year in our minds, culturally. However, as you skim these lists, it’s really important to not get too caught up in them.</p>
        
        <p>Sure, there may be a general consensus of which pieces of art throughout the year were the best, but it is hard to really ever find one piece that truly is the best. Why? Because something being the best, in regard to artistry, is near impossible to achieve. Everything speaks to someone differently. So while you may think Mitski’s <i>Be the Cowboy</i> is just the best music happening to come out of this year, your close pal may think that Snail Mail’s <i>Lush</i> is and that you should get out of here with that Mitski nonsense. Note that these two albums are both popping up on ‘Best of’ lists – give them a listen. </p>
        
        <p>And remember who you are reading the list from. Shea Serrano and Rob Harvilla of <i>The Ringer</i> put out their <a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/12/4/18124867/best-albums-2018">best albums of 2018 list</a> in a collaborative effort. As someone who likes <i>The Ringer</i>, I disagreed with their list at points. Just shows that the taste in what I thought was the best widely differs from that. These lists are great for harboring discussion, and in a way that makes people revisit things or go and take in things that they may have skipped over. From <i>The Ringer</i>, I finally took the time to listen Vince Staples’ <i>FM</i> and it was phenomenal. Sure, I would have probably gotten to listening to it sooner than later, but the fact that it was put in a list in a publication I read often made it “OK, you need to listen to it pronto.”</p>
        
        <p>So while you may have an itching for certain things to be within the top 10, they may not be there. That’s OK. Whatever was defining for you this year, whatever you found solace in, roll with that and have your own top 10 of all these things. Think on them and compare them others, and have fun reading them. But let your 2018 be defined by what made a difference to you. And just have fun while reading, please.</p>
