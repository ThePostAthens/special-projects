        <p>In the wake of the 70 arrests in Baker Center during February 2017, President Duane Nellis established an interim freedom of expression policy in August 2017. The policy banned “demonstrations, rallies, public speech-making, picketing, sit-ins, marches, protests, and similar assemblies” inside university buildings and gave individualized guidelines for outdoor spaces on campus. </p>
        
        <p>Since then, Ohio University’s has implemented Freedom of Expression policies were implemented in July of 2018, which established time, place and manner regulations on campus for indoor and outdoor protests.</p>
        
        <p>Nellis approved three policies regarding free expression on campus. The first included a statement of commitment to free expression, and the two others were policies on the use of indoor and outdoor spaces on the Athens campus, regional campuses and extension campuses.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/46054b1b-98a0-4479-880c-c69a2a2d253b.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Emilee Chinn | PHOTO EDITOR</p><p class="pcut">(From left) Cody Shanklin, Hannah Burke and Mallory Golski stand in front of the crowd of demonstrators during the "It's On Us, Bobcats" rally against sexual assault on College Green on Sep. 27, 2018. (FILE)</p> </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p>The policies were adopted to “ensure that everyday university functions can be accomplished,” according to the statement of commitment to free expression.</p>
        
        <p>The new policies on the use of indoor and outdoor spaces define reservation requirements for gatherings and permission for amplified sound, such as microphones and speakers. The new policies also outline disruption and regulations for distributing literature, according to a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/07/new-freedom-of-expression-policies">previous <i>Post</i> report</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The allowance of protests in indoor spaces is dependent on multiple factors. In order to assemble in indoor spaces, one must reserve the space and in order to reserve a space, there must not be priority over the space for academic purposes. The use of amplified sounds must also be approved in advance to the protest or demonstration. </p>
        
        <p>“The university’s indoor spaces are to be used primarily for purposes related to the institution’s mission and related teaching, learning, studying, research, academic, extracurricular and student life, administrative, and other supporting activities,” the <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/policy/01-042.html">policy</a> reads.</p>
        
        <p>The policy on the use of outdoor spaces also requires reservations through event services. Those reservable spaces include Alumni Gateway table space, Baker 4th floor entrance, Emeriti Park, Walter Hall lawn and Scripps Amphitheater.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">How it came to be</h2></div>

        <p>After the 70 students were arrested, Nellis established a Presidential Policy Advisory Group to research and guide policy development in September 2017. Over the course of last year, the group held private meetings and a public forum in an effort to create a permanent policy to reflect OU’s stance on free speech, according to a previous Post report.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="pq_center">“I think we need to have some kinds of guiding principles relative to free speech, but recognizing that in no way do we want to harbor free speech. We want to encourage the opportunities for free speech. We’re a public university, and that’s across the spectrum”<span class="attribution">President Duane Nellis</span></blockquote>
        
        <p>During that time, the advisory group was met with sharp criticism and copious feedback from faculty, students and staff.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/ed1f7a46-a66f-4339-bbab-6c50c1978554.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Emilee Chinn | PHOTO EDITOR</p><p class="pcut">Bailey Stein, a student studying Plant Biology, chants during the F--k Rape Culture rally on October 19, 2018. (FILE)</p> </div>
        <br>
        
        
        <p>“I think that’s kind of a bipartisan fight,” Ryan Evans, the president of the OU College Republicans, said in a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/09/protest-ban-constitutional-reactions">previous <i>Post</i> report</a> about disagreement regarding the policy. “There are definitely people on the left who want to protest … and that should be absolutely fine, like I said, as long as it doesn’t impede other people’s rights.”</p>
        
        <p>In April, the group <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/04/freedom-of-expression-policy-ou-nellis">released 24 recommendations</a> for the policies which affirmed the importance of expression, but also stated that Cutler Hall and the Baker Center atrium should not be used for “protests, demonstrations, or similar activities,” according to a previous Post report.</p>
        
        <p>In the new policies, demonstrations are permitted in Baker Center and classrooms with or without reservation, when the space is not being used. </p>
        
        <p>Those recommendations were used to help the Executive Staff Policy Committee draft a set of guidelines in April and subsequently, establish permanent policies.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>After a feedback period from April to May, the policy committee continued gathering information from students, faculty and staff to finalize the three new policies.</p>
        
        <p>“I think if we have a policy, there are going to be some groups that are upset with that, period,” Nellis said in a <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/12/duane-nellis-semester-review-ohio-university">previous <i>Post</i> report</a>. “But I think we need to have some kinds of guiding principles relative to free speech, but recognizing that in no way do we want to harbor free speech. We want to encourage the opportunities for free speech. We’re a public university, and that’s across the spectrum.”</p>
