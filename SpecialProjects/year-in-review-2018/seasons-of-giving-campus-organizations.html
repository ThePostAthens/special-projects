        <p>The season of giving is here, and in the past year, campus organizations have dedicated tremendous amounts of time and energy to giving back and supporting important causes.</p>
        
        <p>Courtney Homan, a senior studying communication studies, serves as the president of BobcaThon. BobcaThon is an Ohio University student fundraiser that concludes with a 12-hour dance marathon, which supports the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Ohio.</p>
        
        <p>The Ronald McDonald House for which BobcaThon raises money, located in Columbus, provides housing, food and resources for the families of hospitalized children. Because of the Ronald McDonald House, parents and guardians can stay close as their children go through treatment.</p>
        
        <p>“I just think giving (families) a sense of normality in such a stressful, hard time is so important,” said Homan.</p>
        
        <p>In order to raise money before the dance marathon, the organization hosts fundraisers on a constant basis. Recently, the group hosted a pancake breakfast during Dads Weekend and bingo at Jackie O’s Brewery.</p>
        
        <p>Members of BobcaThon also collect pop tabs, which are then donated to the Ronald McDonald House and recycled to pay the House’s electric bill.</p>
        
        <p>Each member who wishes to dance at the marathon is given a $100 fundraising goal, said Homan.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/c9a3404f-7e47-4c73-8a18-297097873fa1.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Meagan Hall | DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY</p><p class="pcut">Abby Fajack, a senior, teaches a dance to the song "Come On Eileen" during Bobcathon in Baker Ballroom.</p> </div>
        
        <p>With the fundraising leading up to the 2018 dance marathon in February and the donations given the day of the marathon, BobcaThon raised $100,000 for the Ronald McDonald House. Over four years, they have given approximately $233,000.</p>
        
        <p>Members of OU’s Delta Gamma chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed service fraternity, followed the tenements of fellowship, leadership and service as they completed numerous service projects on the local level this year. Members are required to complete hours in each of those sectors.</p>
        
        <p>Monica Bollinger and Kaitlyn Moran are the vice presidents of service in the organization, which has more than 300 brothers and is one of the largest chapters in the country.</p>
        
        <p>Moran, a senior studying accounting, management and strategic leadership and business pre-law, said the members complete weekly service projects, which include helping library staff at West Elementary School, knitting hats to donate and walking dogs at a local shelter.</p>
        
        <p>Alpha Phi Omega hosted an American Red Cross blood drive on Nov. 28 and hosted a local clothing drive this semester.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="pq_center">“We go here, and we kind of want to change the world, but that just starts at a basic level of giving back your time and energy.”<span class="attribution">Kaitlyn Moran</span></blockquote>
        
        <p>“I think it’s really important for college students in Athens to understand that Athens goes beyond just campus and be able to experience other people that actually live here and understand the culture of Appalachia, and to overall get beyond the Athens bubble,” said Bollinger, a senior studying education.</p>
        
        <p>Members within Alpha Phi Omega are placed into families within the fraternity to create stronger relationships, said Bollinger.</p>
        
        <p>The chapter also participates in Alpha Phi Omega’s National Service Week, which takes place the first week of November each year. This year’s focus was on suicide prevention.</p>
        
        <p>“We go here, and we kind of want to change the world, but that just starts at a basic level of giving back your time and energy,” said Moran.</p>
        
        <p>The Omicron Gamma chapter of Delta Zeta at OU has also done its fair share of charitable work this year as well.</p>
        
        <p>Catherine Muscaro, a senior studying journalism, works as the sorority’s vice president of philanthropy. </p>
        
        <p>“I help (members) find those opportunities where you’re giving back to Athens specifically –– that's what we try to do because we live in Athens, and Athens is a poor community,” said Muscaro.</p>
        
        <p>Locally, the sorority supports My Sister’s Place, a domestic violence agency located in Athens that provides shelter, counseling and a 24/7 hotline for victims of violence.</p>
        
        <p>The sorority was able to donate a large assortment of personal care items as well as pillows, blankets, clothing and $1,000 to My Sister’s Place this year. </p>
        
        <p>Delta Zeta also donates gifts for a child during the holiday season through the Santa Tree Project, facilitated by Athens County Children’s Services. Other organizations in Greek life sponsor children as well, Muscaro said. </p>
        
        <p>Nationally, Delta Zeta supports the Starkey Hearing Foundation, which gives hearing aids to those who cannot afford them.</p>
        
        <p>The sorority also sends members as volunteers to The Painted Turtle and raises money to benefit the camp. The Painted Turtle is a summer camp located in California designed for children with chronic, long-term illnesses.</p>
        
        <p>Delta Zeta members must complete 20 service hours per semester and participate in fundraisers that help the sorority give back to the causes it supports.</p>
        
        <p>“The things that we have are privileges and they are things that we need to appreciate,” said Muscaro. “Philanthropy is a great way to do that because you’re constantly reminded of how important it is to give back to people who don’t have the same experiences as you and don’t necessarily have the opportunity to change those things.”</p>
