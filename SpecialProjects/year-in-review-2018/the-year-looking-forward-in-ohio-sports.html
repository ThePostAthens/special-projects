        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>This past year a lot has gone on in the world of Ohio athletics. A new videboard was hung up from the ceiling of The Convo, softball hired a new coach and Ohio football finished the regular season 8-4. All of this bodes well for the Ohio athletic department, but as seasons change, so do years.</p>
        
        <p>Here are five things to look for in Ohio athletics in 2019:</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ohio vs. Central Michigan | Wednesday, Jan. 9</h2></div>

        <p>The Ohio women’s basketball team is off to a 6-0 start, one of its best in the Bob Boldon era. Still, the Bobcats’ toughest test this season will be against Central Michigan on Wednesday, Jan. 9 at The Convo. The Chippewas made the NCAA Tournament last season after a 96-91 win over Buffalo in the Mid-American Conference Tournament Championship Game. More impressive, CMU went on to win two games in the NCAA Tournament to advance to the Sweet 16, eventually losing to Oregon.</p>
        
        <p>CMU is off to a 7-1 start, and the Bobcats and Chippewas seem to be on a collision course. Their first meeting is set for this January date.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Baseball at Wren Stadium</h2></div>
        
        <p>The Bobcats’ baseball team still hasn’t announced their schedule, but this spring they’ll play their first-ever game on the newly installed turf. The upgrade is monumental for the program, most importantly the ability to practice outside in the winter and play home games earlier in the season, which will help the fan base know the team better, too. The installation of turf was only done to the infield, as the outfield will stay grass. Coach Rob Smith has been working on completing the turf project for the past few years.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ohio vs. Buffalo | Tuesday, March 5 </h2></div>
        
        <p>For Ohio men’s basketball, last season didn’t go how many thought it would with the number of injuries the Bobcats were dealt. This season, the Bobcats are off to a 5-2 start, including a win over rival Marshall. The Bulls and Bobcats will meet days before the 2019 MAC Tournament, and by then we’ll know if Ohio is a threat in Cleveland, or if things will be coming to a close.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Start of spring football</h2></div>
        
        <p>Ohio will start spring football in late March or early April. The football program will be entering its 51st season without a MAC Championship, and a few questions will be brought up in spring camp. Javon Hagan announced that he’ll be returning for his redshirt senior season, and quarterback Nathan Rourke will be entering his senior year. Still, Ohio will be without its one-two running back punch of A.J. Ouellette and Maleek Irons, and the Bobcats’ defense will take a hit with multiple leaders leaving due to graduation.</p>
        
        <p>Other questions may arise, and there may be coaching turnover. Ohio will be in good shape, but as usual, there will be areas of focus when spring football gets underway.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Ohio vs. Marshall | Saturday, Sept. 14 </h2></div>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/e4205614-4456-46e7-bcab-1f332d91ed76.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Kelsey Boeing | FOR THE POST</p><p class="pcut">Ohio guard Antonio Cowart Jr. drives into the post during the Bobcats’ game against Marshall on Saturday. (FILE)</p> </div>
        <br>
        
        <p>The “Battle of the Bell” rivalry will be renewed next fall, the first meeting between the two teams since Ohio defeated Marshall at Peden Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015. The rivalry has come and gone throughout coach Frank Solich’s tenure in Athens, but it’s been filled with storied games. It’s the only rivalry Ohio plays in where a trophy is on the line, and whenever the two teams meet a large crowd is usually guaranteed.</p>
