        <p>Ohio’s season wasn’t supposed to end like this.</p>
        
        <p>It wasn’t supposed to end with one final short, depressing huddle of Bobcats in the middle of Millett Hall’s floor in Oxford. They briefly wrapped their arms around each other after Meredith Howe couldn’t corral a serve from Ball State’s Kate Avila. The ball bounced off Howe’s arm. Then it bounced off Simone Miller’s head. Then it slowly bounced away. </p>
        
        <p>It was the Cardinals’ winning point in the fifth set of the second-round match of the Mid-American Conference Tournament. It was also the final depressing play the Bobcats suffered this season, one that ended far sooner than anyone imagined four months earlier.</p>
        
        <p>Ohio was selected to win the regular season of the conference, East Division and championship titles in August in the MAC coaches’ preseason poll. The Bobcats weren’t thinking that far ahead yet — they had several key players <a href="http://projects.thepostathens.com/SpecialProjects/welcome-back-2018/full-strength-volleyball.html">returning from injuries</a> sustained in 2017, a season also filled with potential never met because some of Ohio’s best players were hurt.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/94ed81c9-2bdd-448c-8d91-43b02722a049.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="descutner" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Kelsey Boeing | FOR THE POST</p><p class="pcut">Ohio University setter, Kyra Slavik, pulling a ball away from the net to her outside hitter in Athens, Ohio, on Friday, September 7, 2018. </p> </div>
        
        <p>But the Bobcats had every reason to believe this season would be different. Coach Deane Webb installed stricter jump limits for players in practice and took measures to ensure that his team would be healthy when Ohio was in the thick of the postseason.</p>
        
        <p>“I think we're a good enough team this year to play for a while to go into the postseason,” Webb said in August. “If we're in that situation, then we're going to make sure that we still have quite a bit left in the tank that time of year.”</p>
        
        <p>Webb’s plan worked. All of Ohio’s starters were healthy when it entered the MAC Tournament, and it only had one key player, Tia Jimerson, miss multiple games with an injury. The core of the Bobcats’ offensive attack — Lizzie Stephens, Jaime Kosiorek and Vera Giacomazzi — played in every set in 2018.</p>
        
        <p>But it still felt like the Bobcats limped into the postseason.</p>
        
        <p>It started back in September when Ohio grinded through a difficult nonconference schedule it hoped would callous itself for the rest of the season. The schedule included Nebraska, reigning NCAA Tournament champions, and four other Power 5 conference schools.</p>
        
        <p>The Bobcats entered MAC play with a 5-8 record, respectable for a team that played more matches in flyover states than The Convo and faced some of the top volleyball schools in the country.</p>
        
        <p>Ohio was calloused up, but it didn’t work as it may have hoped.</p>
        
        <p>After a 3-1 start to begin the easiest part of its conference schedule, Ohio crumbled. It won just three matches, lost three five-set matches and could only beat one team, Eastern Michigan, with a conference record over .500 in October.</p>
        
        <p>The Bobcats were nowhere near the team MAC coaches predicted when they filled out their preseason ballots. They were arguably the most mediocre team in the conference and finished the regular season 1-8 against teams with a MAC record over .500.</p>
        
        <p>Ohio’s offense was supposed to be dominant. It had Stephens, a member of the 2017 All-MAC First Team; Jimerson, who won 2017 MAC Freshman of the Year; and Kosiorek, who was on pace to smash Ohio’s all-time career service ace record.</p>
        
        <p>Kosiorek broke the record on Oct. 19, but that was arguably Ohio’s highest offensive moment of the season. The Bobcats finished seventh in the conference in hitting percentage (.199) and averaged a .164 hitting percentage against MAC teams with a record over .500.</p>
        
        <p>Webb always wanted his offense to be aggressive — and it was — but it always seemed to falter in the biggest moments. The Bobcats were only 1-6 in five-set matches in 2018, and the lone win came in Ohio’s first five-set match on Sept. 7.</p>
        
        <p>“You don’t want to be a scared-to-hit-the-ball type of team,” Webb said on Oct. 27. “You want to still go for it, but you have to earn the right to be aggressive with your feet.”</p>
        
        <p>So when the Bobcats entered the MAC Tournament in Oxford, they didn’t have either of the two regular season awards many thought they would earn. All they had were seven conference wins, a disappointing seventh seed and a long road toward attaining the final award that was supposed to be there’s to lose.</p>
        
        <p>There was hope, albeit a small amount, that they could still string three more wins together after sweeping Northern Illinois in the first round, but anyone who followed Ohio’s regular season could see what was next.</p>
        
        <p>A disheartening end to the season.</p>
