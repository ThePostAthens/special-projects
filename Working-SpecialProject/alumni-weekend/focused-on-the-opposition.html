        <p>Come this weekend, the Ohio Hockey Hall of Fame will enshrine three new members, Bill Gurnick, Tiff Clark and Ryan Johnston. Celebrations will also be held in honor of the 60th season and, in the mix, will feature a series between No. 5 Ohio and Pittsburgh.</p>
        
        <p>The Bobcats step out of league play for the first time in 2018 with their final home series of January, which has proved to unfavorable to them — they’re just 1-3 in the new year.</p>
        
        <p>Coach Sean Hogan hopes Ohio can right the ship this series.</p>
        
        <p>“We need to make sure that we play a focused game,” Hogan said. “If we come out with energy and we play our game, we’re capable of beating anybody.”</p>
        
        <p>Ohio and Pitt are familiar with one another, too. Last season, the Bobcats took both games from the Panthers in lopsided 9-0 and 8-4 victories.</p>
        
        <p>Following a Bryan Lubin goal that gave Ohio a 5-2 lead in the Saturday game a year ago, Pitt skaters took out their mounting frustrations — and the ensuing brawl was nothing short of pure, genuine, hockey gold.</p>
        
        <p>Too much is at stake this year, though, for the Bobcats to engage in too serious of net-scrums.</p>
        
        <p>“We won’t allow (fighting),” Hogan said. “We’re not overlooking this weekend, but we can’t afford any suspensions. … Next weekend, we have to go to Robert Morris-Illinois; they’re No. 4 and we’re No.5, we’ll need everybody.”</p>
        
        <p>For Ohio (18-7-1) to win this weekend, it all goes back to the basics. Following an odd 5-4 loss to then No. 12 Iowa State last Saturday, the Bobcats have tirelessly worked on its defensive zone play and empty net situations — two things that would have won them last Saturday’s game.</p>
        
        <p>Alongside of tightening up on defense, the Bobcats high amount of speedy players will be extremely focal if they can manage to win this weekend's games.</p>
        
        <p>“Guys like (Gianni Evangelisti) and (Bryan) Lubin need to drive the net through the middle of the ice, kick the puck while driving through the middle of the ice,” Hogan said. “And that will make it very difficult for Pitt to stop (us).”</p>
        
        <p>In comparison, Pitt (15-8-0) recently regained senior forward Brett Oldaker, who, in his first game back, totaled three points against Kent State.</p>
        
        <p>Oldaker, a transfer from NCAA Division III school Franklin Pierce, has both the size and speed capabilities that Ohio itself heavily relies on to win games.</p>
        
        <p>But Oldaker is just one player, not a team.</p>
        
        <p>As a whole team, Hogan sees the differences between the Pitt program from a year ago and the present day team.</p>
        
        <p>“I think this year, they’re a lot better than last,” Hogan said. “They added a couple of players at the semester; I think offensively they’re much better.”</p>
        
        <p>Even with the additions and improvements, however, confidence within the Ohio locker room hasn’t wavered.</p>
        
        <p>“If we play our game, they shouldn’t get chances on us,” Hogan said.</p>
        
        <p>Whether or not if Ohio can play its game is entirely up to itself, but it has its first test Friday at 7:30 p.m.</p>
