<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The call came out of the blue.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Animator Katie Frasier was working at a bank. It was a job she never wanted after college.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For (number) months, Frasier struggled to find jobs related to her masters. when South Park Studios asked her to come in for an interview to work as an animator.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It was kinda luck,&rdquo; Frasier, a 2010 OU alumna<em>, </em>said. The competition to get jobs within the animation industry was hard, she said. However, she was determined to keep working on independent projects while applying for animation positions.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And her determination paid off when she became the animation generalist for the 20th season of <em>South Park.</em></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Animation programs are now more common in universities across the nation. Ohio University&rsquo;s School of Media Arts and Studies&rsquo; games and animation program was recently announced as the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.ohio.edu/scrippscollege/news-story.cfm?newsItem=F5939607-5056-A874-1DAD2DB86F3C2174">second best animation program in Ohio</a>, and one of the top 10 animation programs in the Midwest.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As of Fall 2017, the program has a total of 826 undergraduate and graduate students, Judy Wilson, the administrative service assistant for the School of Media Arts and Studies, said. The school is also expanding its program, offering a new three-year <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://ouscrippsmfa.com/">MFA in communication media arts</a>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although animation is commonly associated with children TV shows, it plays a major role in daily life. From animated commercials of cereal brands to the mythical creatures on television shows like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, animation has been used to bring ideas to reality.</p>
        <br>
<div class="box">
             <h3>Traditional animation:</h3>Also known as cel animation. Each frame is hand-drawn to create an animation sequence,and the illusion of movement is created as you flip through sequential drawings. 
    <br>Examples: Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/1117R79gZvBlx6" width="480" height="288" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/snow-white-ginnifer-goodwin-dreamcaster-1117R79gZvBlx6">via GIPHY</a></p></div>
        
<h2 style="font-family:montserrat;" class="subhed" >The effort behind the magic</h2>
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When a person watches animated films or plays video games, they are often unaware of the amount of time, effort and technical skills poured into the product.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Emelia Douglas began her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in games and animation, &ldquo;it was like a reality check.&rdquo;</p>
    
        <blockquote class="pq_right">"Especially (when I was) starting out, it would take hours and hours to do just two or three seconds of work."<span class="attribution">Emelia Douglas, an OU 2017 alumna</span></blockquote>
        
        
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I finally understood why it took cartoon studios and various TV shows so long to come out, because it takes forever to animate,&rdquo; Douglas said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Creating an animation is more than just drawing or making a 3-D model move as different types of animation require specific skill sets.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Stop-motion animators learn about lighting on sets, camera angles and how to make armatures for clay characters, whereas 3-D animators need to know how to build and paint a virtual world from scratch while designing and animating, Tyler Ayres, an assistant professor in the school of media arts and studies at OU, said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an enormous amount of work,&rdquo; Ayres said. &ldquo;That (amount) is even doubled or quadrupled when you&rsquo;re talking about all the (work) that goes into (pre-production).&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Combined with the toll of being in a competitive field, many young animators face the problem of experiencing burnout.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Taylor Rohrig experienced it during her sophomore year. She broke down when she realized the time she was spending working on her animation was affecting her social life.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After her realization, Rohrig, now a senior studying games and animation, reconsidered her path in the animation industry and questioned if creating art 24/7 was something she wanted to do for the rest of her life.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not OK, you gotta be OK to step back,&rdquo; Rohrig&nbsp;said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instead of animating, she now focuses on production as she finds she works better with people.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Taking care of yourself is the most important thing in this industry,&rdquo; Rohrig said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not taking care of yourself, you won&rsquo;t be able to put a 100 percent into your work.&rdquo;</p>

             <h3>2-D vector-based animation:</h3> Similar to traditional animation, but utilizes computer generated animations in place of cels. <br>Examples: The Simpsons
        <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jUwpNzg9IcyrK" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-simpsons-scared-homer-simpson-jUwpNzg9IcyrK">via GIPHY</a></p></div>    
        
<h2 style="font-family:montserrat;" class="subhed" >Determination pays off</h2>      
        
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ayres has always been interested in animation as a career, but animation programs were still uncommon when he began his undergraduate degree at Ohio State University back in 1994.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Becoming an animator seemed impossible when he was younger, he said. The animated TV shows and films he grew up watching were made by larger animation studios across the country. Even then, aspiring animators would have to compete with other artists for the same job at an animation studio.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ayres continued to make short-animated films focusing on children&rsquo;s entertainment in his spare time after graduating with a degree in graphic design. When a friend from OSU&rsquo;s digital animation and interactive media program showed Ayres the work he was creating, he decided to make the leap to quit his job and go back to grad school.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Really all I wanted to do was to get my animation into a film festival,&rdquo; Ayres said. &ldquo;I wanted to be &lsquo;the name&rsquo; and if I could just try that, I just wanted to give it a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The leap paid off when Ayres&rsquo;s graduate thesis film <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmXUoorhSOA"><em>RED &amp; Blue</em></a> was screened at several film festivals and even shortlisted as a finalist at the Nicktoons Film Festivals.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I was kinda taken back and also addicted from then on because I knew I could do it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After graduating from Savannah College of Art and Design, Frasier had a difficult time working as an animator. Even at South Park Studios, the job was demanding.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Art can be so much tied to yourself, it&rsquo;s not a job where you do it and then when you go home you can forget about it (and) it can be kind of challenging to progress,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But between working with really talented people and producing new content every day, the experience was incredible, she said. Frasier has since left the job, but her art techniques and time management skills have greatly improved due to her time at the studio.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The hours were really long&hellip; so it was rough, but I learned so much in that short period of time,&rdquo; Frasier said.</p>

 <h2 style="font-family:montserrat;" class="subhed" >Advancements in technology</h2>   
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">New innovations and animation programs are being created every day, and Aaron DiManna believes the quality of computer-generated animation is rapidly improving.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;(James Cameron&rsquo;s) <em>Avatar</em> was amazing (when it came out) but now it&rsquo;s not as impressive,&rdquo; DiMana, a senior studying animation, said. &ldquo;But if you show (the film) to the people who made <em>King Kong</em>, they&rsquo;ll be amazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&rsquo;s possible for animation to get &ldquo;really close to reality&rdquo; to the point where it&rsquo;ll become tougher to discern between a computer generated image and reality, Ayres said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That level of what&rsquo;s the most realistic game this year is probably much better than the most realistic game two years ago, four years ago or, god forbid, 10 years ago,&rdquo; Ayres said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The rapid progression of technology is not limited to computer programs. The accessibility of the internet has also allowed aspiring animators to reach out to others in the industry and give independent creators the chance to show off their work without being tied to a larger studio.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">More than 10 of <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/23/14029006/best-games-of-2017">Polygon&rsquo;s list of 2017&rsquo;s video games to look forward to</a> are produced by indie studios, some being part of the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.techradar.com/news/cuphead-5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-xbox-indie-darling">most highly anticipated independent games</a> to come out this year.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The ability to self-publish content to the internet has allowed creators to tell a variety of stories and utilize different styles of animation, Frasier said. Although it can be difficult for an animator to stand out due to the overwhelming amount of content available on the internet, Frasier believes the internet has helped creators reach audiences across the globe.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great thing that you can make something at your house and have it shown all over the world,&rdquo; she said.</p>

        <br>
<div class="box">
             <h3>Motion graphics:</h3>Unlike the other types of animation, motion graphics are usually not story driven or character-based. Used to create moving graphic elements or texts. <br> Examples: Film opening titles, animated logos
    <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/aQv8ArIyLWCBi" width="480" height="258" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/animation-redmond-aQv8ArIyLWCBi">via GIPHY</a></p>

<h2 style="font-family:montserrat;" class="subhed" >To aspiring animators</h2>        
        
        
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The animation industry can be stressful and may not provide a stable life to young animators, Frasier said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I do think if you choose animation you should be enjoying it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be so stressed out about trying to be technically perfect. &hellip; It should still be enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The internet is a &ldquo;boundless resource&rdquo; for aspiring animators, DiManna said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Free animation programs, YouTube tutorials and forums are all available online for anyone who has access to a computer. With so many options, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s almost no reason to not be using them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Frasier said the most important thing for an animator is the determination to constantly improve oneself.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cliche but the more you draw, the better you will get,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just make stuff and put it out there.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <br>
<div class="box">
             <h3>Stop motion:</h3>Similar to traditional animation but utilizes real life materials such as clay or puppets instead of drawings.Movement is created by taking a photo of an object, and moving its pose before taking the next sequential photo. When the photos are played back one after the other, they give the illusion of movement. <br> Examples: Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit
