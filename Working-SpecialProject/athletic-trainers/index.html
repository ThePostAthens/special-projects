        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>Annabelle&bull; Herron is the &bull;sole athletic trainer for &bull;Nelsonville-York High School. Amidst all the commotion of a high school &bull;wrestling match, she stands calm as she observes, ready to assist if needed. </p>
        
        <p>She is a &bull;first year graduate student who is one of &bull;45 students in &bull;Ohio University&rsquo;s &bull;graduate program for athletic training. In &bull;Southeast Ohio, having a college student as an athletic trainer at the high school level is&bull; not uncommon. </p>
        
        <p>Toward the end of the wrestling meet, an athlete lays on the mat, in too much pain to get up. Herron walks onto the mat and talks to the athlete for a few minutes before helping him to his knees, and then gradually his feet. &nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I am that person making the decisions, it forces me to be confident in what I'm saying and what I've learned,&rdquo; Herron said. </p>
        
        <p>OU students in the athletic training program are able to gain educational experience in their </p>
        <p>field while providing a service to an area that <a>lacks medical care</a>. &nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Making the calls </strong></p>
        
        <p>Through the graduate program,&bull; 43 of those &bull;45 students have &bull;graduate assistantships where OU provides athletic trainers to&bull; local high schools,&bull; intercollegiate athletics and &bull;campus recreation, &bull;Chad Starkey, a &bull;professor in the &bull;School of Applied Health Sciences and Wellness, said. </p>
        
        <p>"All the graduate students are licensed athletic trainers which means that technically they could go work full-time anyplace they want,&rdquo; Starkey said.</p>
        
        <p>As part of the graduate assistantship, which started in&bull; 1977, &bull;20 high schools in the area have athletic trainers because of the program. The high schools each receive one athletic trainer who is a graduate student, Starkey said. </p>
        
        <p>The students are paid for &bull;20 hours a week and receive academic credit for &bull;10 hours a week. The stipends range from&bull; $9,000 to &bull;$13,000 for Athens-based students, Starkey said. The 20-hours per week is&bull; fixed and earns the graduate student their &bull;stipend, Starkey said. </p>
        
        <p>During busy times during the academic year, a graduate student may &bull;35 hours, but OU&rsquo;s program makes sure that is then offset with a&bull; 25 hour week, Starkey said. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;In rare cases where a student is over-worked the program intervenes on their behalf,&rdquo; Starkey said in an email.</p>
        
        <p>The &bull;clinical coordinator makes sure students 
        stay within the&bull; hour range, Starkey said. </p>
        
        <p>When a player is injured, it is up to the athletic trainers to decide if he or she can play or not. </p>
        
        <p>"Sometimes it's hard (and) sometimes I struggle with it,&rdquo;&bull; Emily Manfresca, the &bull;athletic trainer at &bull;Trimble High School, said. &ldquo;I'll look at what's wrong and talk to them obviously and see where they are not just physically, but mentally.&rdquo; </p>
        
        <p>If an athlete is injured, Manfresca will modify what he or she can do, such as &bull;shooting baskets, but not &bull;sprinting in practice. For her, there are challenges that come along with working at a high school.</p>
        
        <p>"Sometimes it's frustrating because I have to remember that they're minors,&rdquo; Manfresca said. &ldquo;Sometimes you can talk to a college athlete a little differently than you can a high school athlete." </p>
        
        <p>Herron is &bull;cautious when it comes to making decisions about an athlete&rsquo;s injury because she is still in her&bull; first year of graduate school, she said. </p>
        
        <p> &ldquo;Hopefully I'll be more decisive (in the future), but &hellip; sometimes it terrifies me knowing that I'm&bull; 23 making health care decisions for these kids,&rdquo; Herron said.</p>
        
        <p>She said the emergency cases are easier to treat. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;The (cases) that you think you would literally just break down and freak out about, those are the easy ones because you know your steps, you know what you're supposed to do,&rdquo; Herron said. </p>
        
        <p><strong>The track to training </strong></p>
        
        <p>Mitchell &bull;McKay, the &bull;athletic trainer for &bull;Athens High School, knows firsthand how important his job can be. </p>
        
        <p>During the &bull;homecoming football game in his &bull;senior year of high school, he sustained a &bull;concussion.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;When I got tackled it was like an electrical shock straight down my head all the way to my tailbone,&rdquo; McKay, a&bull; second year &bull;graduate student in the athletic training program, said. &ldquo;The next thing I remember was being in the ER, finding out it was 36 hours later."</p>
        
        <p>Up until that hit, McKay said he had &bull;aspirations to play football beyond high school, but that &bull;injury changed everything. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I sustained a severe concussion &hellip; which basically made me not want to play football in college, but I wanted to be around sports,&rdquo; McKay said. </p>
        
        <p>After recovering from his concussion, he started job shadowing one of his athletic trainers. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I really liked the idea of not being stuck in a cubicle all day, being able to be on a court or a football field,&rdquo; McKay said. </p>
        
        <p>Some athletic trainers, like Herron, decided on the career because of her love of medicine. &nbsp;Despite her love, Herron was not sold on the idea of &bull;medical school. </p>
        
        <p>"Being at a high school where we had an athletic training, it kind of bridged that gap to where it wasn't necessarily med school, but it was medicine,&rdquo; Herron said. &ldquo;I love the atmosphere of athletics.&rdquo; </p>
        
        <p><strong>Servicing Students </strong></p>
        
        <p>The athletic trainers at the high schools are the &bull;&ldquo;primary health care providers&rdquo; for student athletes, Starkey said. </p>
        
        <p>"Southeast Ohio is one of the most medically underserved in the nation,&rdquo; Starkey said. &ldquo;The kids at most of these high schools would not have these type of health care without this program."</p>
        
        <p>For Manfresca, her &bull;third week on the job opened her eyes to need her athletes exhibited. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I had a junior high mother come to me and say 'I think my daughter's foot broken. We don't have insurance. Can you look at her and tell me what you think?' &rdquo; Manfresca, a &bull;first year graduate student in the athletic training program, said. </p>
        
        <p>She said she has also noticed &bull;&ldquo;little things&rdquo; about the way the athletes approach medical care. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>"Even if it's (saying) something as simple as &lsquo;go back to your doctor to get your stitches removed,&rsquo; &rdquo; Manfresca said. &ldquo;They'll be like 'oh my dad will just cut them out.&rsquo; "</p>
        
        <p>At Nelsonville, when Herron tells an athlete to see a doctor and they usually have the opportunity to seek that care, but not all athletes in the school have that option, she said. </p>
        
        <p>"I exhaust every limit that i have until I'm out of answers,&rdquo; Herron said. </p>
        
        <p>Some of the reasons her student-athletes are not able to seek medical attention including &bull;financial struggles, not having &bull;healthcare coverage or insurance or having a &bull;"rub some (dirt) on it" mentality, Herron said. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;Medical care oppositions for southeastern Ohio are sometimes scarce and might not be the best option for my patients,&rdquo; Herron said in an email. &ldquo;Therefore they would have to travel to Columbus.&rdquo; </p>
        
        <p>McKay said the one of the most rewarding parts about being an athletic trainer is when a parent or athlete is grateful for the trainer&rsquo;s service. He likes seeing a previously injured athlete fully recovered, due to his treatment. </p>
        
        <p>Aside from treating injured athletes, it is also the athletic trainers&rsquo; job to keep the coaches updated about injured athletes. </p>
        
        <p>"(The coaches have) been very willing to work with me and trust my opinion,&rdquo; McKay said. </p>
        
        <p>Stewart said having an athletic trainer gives him &bull;peace of mind. McKay is the &bull;fourth athletic trainer Stewart has gotten to know during his &bull;12 year career on the baseball staff. </p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;One thing for me personally as a baseball coach is that it gives me extreme peace of mind knowing that there&rsquo;s someone more qualified than myself or my staff to handle injuries and issues that the players are dealing with physically,&rdquo; Stewart said. </p>
