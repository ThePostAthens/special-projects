        <h4  id="byline" class="column20center"><strong>Rebekah Barnes /</strong> <span class="title">Senior Writer</span></h4>
        
        <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t&rsquo;s essentially just a big warehouse.</p>

        <p>Some may be bigger than others, but they all have pretty much the same contents. There&rsquo;s a floor covered in blue pilling fabric with long lanes going from one end to the other. There&rsquo;s a long runway of that same blue fabric with a giant vault that girls run full speed toward, no matter their size or their age. There are balance beams so close someone could just hop between one and the next. There are sets of uneven bars wincing with each spin someone&rsquo;s calloused hands take around them.</p>

        <p>They all kind of smell the same too &mdash; a distinct odor of chalk, sweat and stale air.</p>

        <p>They&rsquo;re all essentially the same but in Appalachia, gymnastics gyms are few and far between.   Athens is only about two hours south of where Olympic gold-medalist Gabby Douglas trained at Buckeye Gymnastics for the Rio Olympics. But this isn&rsquo;t Columbus.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;In areas like Columbus where they might have 10 gyms just within that one city, they have a lot more kids and can run a lot of kids through their programs,&rdquo; said Liz Nulter, office manager and head team coach of Gymniks Gymnastics in Vienna, about an hour from Athens. &ldquo;But just here it&rsquo;s sometimes really cool to see a kid that does travel 45 minutes to just to come to a 45 minute class just to see how much they love (it), and they want to come that bad.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s double the class time spent in the car, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon. It just comes with the territory, said Adrianne Roettker, owner of Southern Ohio Gymnastics Academy in Gallipolis, about an hour away.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rural,&rdquo; Roettker said. &ldquo;Everybody has to drive, almost. I have people that have to drive 50 minutes to get here, which in a sense one way is good because you don&rsquo;t really have any competition. Like my nearest competition is 45 minutes away, and we&rsquo;re friends with all the neighboring gyms. But we all have the same issues. Everybody&rsquo;s got to drive to find a place for gymnastics.&rdquo;   The Sport</p>

        <p>Artistic gymnastics is divided between men and women. Men&rsquo;s gymnastics involves six apparatuses: rings, floor exercise, vault, pommel horse, horizontal bar and parallel bars. Women&rsquo;s gymnastics involves four: floor exercise, uneven bars, vault and beam. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the United States Gymnastics team brought home 12 medals (four gold, six silver and two bronze) between team finals and individuals events. The men&rsquo;s team for the Olympics has five members with an average age of 25. The women&rsquo;s: also five members, with an average age of 19.</p>

        <p>For the 2020 Olympics, six athletes will be eligible to compete in qualification rounds, but only four in team finals, according to the International Federation of Gymnastics. </p>

        <p>Under the elite status (the highest level of gymnastics where athletes can compete internationally) are Junior Olympic levels from one to 10, falling under USA Gymnastics&rsquo; governance umbrella.</p>

        <p>Within the Junior Olympic program, levels one through five are mandated across the board, which means all the routines across the country are the same until the athletes surpass level five. In 2011, USA Gymnastics created a new program called &ldquo;Xcel.&rdquo; That is separated into five levels where athletes and coaches can customize their routines. </p>

        <p>That creativity and customization can be important in a sport where the average age when kids drop out is right around middle school, said Roettker, Nulter and Shawn Wilson, owner of Global Gymnastics in Athens.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We definitely keep girls more than we would have [through offering the Xcel program],&rdquo; said Esther Weibel, Ohio University gymnastics coach and head coach at Global Gymnastics. &ldquo;Our team tends to lean more toward Xcels, but I think we have a good program running. Our girls have a lot of fun with it.&rdquo; </p>

        <p>Below the competitive level are recreation classes, which can include everything from toddlers and their parents in the gym together or basic skills classes that go for about an hour once a week.</p>

        <p>The recreation classes work on skills such as staying in lines, listening to directions and body awareness.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s definitely where any kid that would be part of our team would learn the basics,&rdquo; Nulter said. &ldquo;We always pick them out of our rec program. Some of them, they might not have been in there very long depending on how quickly they could pick things up, but usually they&rsquo;ll be in classes a couple of years before they have the skills they would need to start competing.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Gyms around the Athens area can have between 300 and 500 athletes enrolled. In an Olympic year, gyms prepare to see growth after kids get exposure to gymnastics through mass media outlets in ways that are not present in off-years. Roettker said she saw about a 25-percent increase in enrollment following the 2012 Olympics in London, after the women&rsquo;s gymnastics team won gold for the first time since 1996 in Atlanta.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;[Boys] never realize it&rsquo;s something boys can do, and they&rsquo;ll see them doing gymnastics on TV &#8230; so that kind of sparks the boys&rsquo; program a little bit,&rdquo; Weibel said. &ldquo;But it definitely sparks the girls program, in my experience. USA Gymnastics &#8230; kind of (tries) to prepare for that. They send out all kinds of stuff to help with the programs and advice on what to do for that Olympic year.&rdquo;   The Commitment</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for kids on competitive teams to to practice three to four hours per day.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;[The] team program, ... it really teaches the kids responsibility because being on team here and anywhere in gymnastics is a huge responsibility for a child,&rdquo; Weibel said. &ldquo;They practice three hours a day, and that&rsquo;s a lot of time for them, especially when they go to school for eight hours.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>For collegiate gymnasts not in school-sponsored varsity programs, the adjustment can be a bit jarring. Elizabeth Vulgamore is president of the OU club gymnastics team and said she went from practicing every day for four hours to once-a-week, two-hour practices. However, the team still has a large time commitment.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;College classes take so much more time than high school classes, and even though we are practicing much less, we have a fundraising opportunity and community service opportunity &mdash; something to do with the team at least once a week as well,&rdquo; Vulgamore, a senior studying exercise physiology, said. &ldquo;Then I work on top of it as well, and there&rsquo;s so much more going on so that&rsquo;s really, really challenging.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The team is co-ed and fundraises to pay for competition fees. They pay a $30 fee upfront and $10 per practice at Global Gymnastics with Weibel. </p>

        <p>Weibel herself was on the team during her years at OU during (INSERT).</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard transition [from high school to college gymnastics],&rdquo; Weibel said. &ldquo;For me physically, just going from high school to college, your body is changing. You don&rsquo;t know what to eat, your body &#8230; it&rsquo;s different, so for me physically, it just helped me make that transition a little easier. I was still working out on a consistent basis and doing the skills I knew how to do without just dropping off and changing my whole life.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;When you commit your life that much to something, it&rsquo;s hard to just drop off and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Before switching to practicing at Global Gymnastics, the team used to drive to a gym an hour in Lancaster, adding an extra two hours onto a two-hour practice.</p>

        <p>Finances can also play a large role in running a gym in Appalachia, Roettker said.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Economics is different. We have to scale down our prices,&rdquo; Roettker said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to pay here what you would have to pay in the city.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Team tuition costs can depend on level and location, but they can cost from $150 to $250 per month. That does not include costs to compete, team charges, leotards and other fees that may be on the side.</p>

        <p>Nulter said gymnastics competition fees can be about $100, but those fees can include an entrance gift such as a T-shirt or leotard.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;A lot of the price of one entry goes toward insurance to have a meet in a high school and to bring in that equipment &mdash; there&rsquo;s so many fees of insurance,&rdquo; Nulter said. &ldquo;Just like equipment rental, if you were hosting a meet and you rent equipment, it can be like $8,000 for one weekend just to rent the equipment so there&rsquo;s a lot of expenses that go into hosting a meet.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;&#8230; It&rsquo;s hard sometimes especially when we&rsquo;re picking a new team and we have to go over all of that stuff &mdash; that is my least favorite part of it. I always have a meeting &#8230; just where I invite everyone that&rsquo;s interested, and I go over, &lsquo;This is how much a competition is, this is how much tuition is and then you have a leotard then you have to travel to each meet.&rsquo; &#8230; That&rsquo;s just how gymnastics is.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>More kids are coming through the recreation programs, which essentially pays for the majority of the gym&rsquo;s operations, Roettker said.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Gymnastics gyms are not big money makers. I&rsquo;m not rich &mdash; I don&rsquo;t intend to ever be &mdash; but I didn&rsquo;t go into for that,&rdquo; Roettker said. &ldquo;You have to be passionate about the kids and want to see them (succeed).&rdquo;</p>

        <p>And then there are the families of the athletes.</p>

        <p>Many athletes spend all day at school and the gym, and they might not see their parents until night, Nulter said.  Roettker&rsquo;s son doesn&rsquo;t go to her gym. Dexter, 17, coaches at Southern Ohio Gymnastics Academy, but he is an elite gymnast in Lancaster and stays with another family for most of the week.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s challenging, balancing everything, but it definitely helps me in the long run,&rdquo; Dexter said.</p>

        <p>Misti Goody, secretary at Southern Ohio Gymnastics Academy, works their to help pay for her two kids to participate in the sport. She was offered a job cleaning, and Roettker then offered her a secretarial job. Goody does that (and a lot more in between). She said she probably spends about $2,000 each a year for competitions and other gymnastics expenses.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I even work on the weekends here sometimes, sometimes Saturday and Sunday, so there&rsquo;s times that we&rsquo;re here seven days a week and it could be sometimes a month straight,&rdquo; Goody said. &ldquo;The most difficult times are when they&rsquo;ve been here so much. &#8230; It can be a little bit of a struggle.&rdquo;   The Impact</p>

        <p>Goody credits gymnastics with helping her son&rsquo;s behavior.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;My son he has ADHD, and when he first started, he was on quite a bit of medication (for it) and to sleep &#8230; but now he&rsquo;s completely off all of his ADHD medication, and now he has to take something to help him sleep every once in awhile, but we&rsquo;re slowly getting him off of that too,&rdquo; Goody said.</p>

        <p>Her son, 13, even said the same thing: he used to have anger and attention problems, but gymnastics has helped him calm down. Being a boy in a sport often dominated by women can create stereotypes.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;(Gymnastics) is just as good for boys as it is for girls, and that is one drawback to Appalachia &mdash; just the stereotype,&rdquo; Roettker said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the strongest men in the world, and it&rsquo;s great for all boys but especially when you get a boy that&rsquo;s small and muscular and maybe can&rsquo;t do football.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>But it can translate to other sports.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;One [parent] in particular, her son plays soccer and football and numerous other sports, but he&rsquo;s always been picked out by the coach wherever he is and she credits his background in gymnastics carrying over into other sports,&rdquo; Wilson said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic sport for anyone to get involved with. Whether it&rsquo;s transferring over into another sport, building confidence or even just playing in the backyard or playing on the playground. There are a lot of physical benefits to it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>That can all start from the basics.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We get little kids that have no idea how to run, have no idea how to hop &mdash; any awareness of their body because kids don&rsquo;t play outside,&rdquo; Roettker said. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s kind of my passion for it is to bring to kids what they need physically.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Weibel said growing up as a gymnast helped her academically and socially because she was homeschooled. Now in her role as a coach, she sees the impact the sport can have on young kids and the social aspects of the sport for the college athletes.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Skill-wise, one year can make such a difference in the skills and their confidence, and it&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; Weibel said. &ldquo;You can look at scores, but scores are always up and down, ... but you see the confidence in the girls and how they perform and what they do as a team. I like to see the girls when they get their new team, and they&rsquo;re so shy and closed off and by state meet, they&rsquo;re like drama mamas &#8230; the most confident thing in the world, and that&rsquo;s pretty exciting to see.&rdquo;</p>
    
        <p>Weibel said she hopes the presence of the gym makes a difference throughout the community after Global Gymnastics moved from Nelsonville to Athens in Sept. 2015. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Some of the school districts around, like Trimble and Federal Hocking, they don&rsquo;t have a great success rate as far as children graduating, going to college,&rdquo; Weibel said. &ldquo;I think enrolling your kids in gymnastics teaches (them) responsibility and teaches that drive to perform and get better at things, and I think that being around this area with schools that are really struggling is hopefully going to be able to help.&rdquo;</p>

        <p> Although the area might not be heavily populated with gymnasts, Roettker said the lessons and skills learned from the sport are still important to integrate in the area.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I felt like children in Appalachia &#8230; deserve the kind of gymnastics that you get in a Columbus or Cincinnati,&rdquo; Roettker said. &ldquo;There is just a different level of training of the coaches and different philosophy, and I just wanted to see that happen here.&rdquo;</p>
