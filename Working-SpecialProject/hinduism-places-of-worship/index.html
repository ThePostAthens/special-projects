        <div class="column20center">
            <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>uddhists, Muslims, Jewish students and those practicing many other ideologies have a building to <a href="http://athensohio.com/community/religious-centers/religious-centers-places-worship/">worship in Athens.</a> 
            </p>

            <p>One spiritual tradition not represented in Athens is Hinduism.

            </p>

            <p>Without a temple, students like Chinky Dhingra who are Hindu can practice their beliefs outside a formal institution.</p>
        
            <p>“For me, I have a collage that has all the pictures of all the gods,” Dhingra, a graduate student studying computer science, said. “I framed it out and keep it in my home.”

            </p>
           
            <p>Hinduism is not represented in a community center or place of worship in Athens, but some Hindu students do not think a local temple is necessary because of alternative ways of worship. 

  </p>
            

            
            <h2 class="subhed" id="sectionname">New Views of Hinduism</h2>

            <p>Hinduism is a set of traditions followed by people in India and Nepal and people of Indian descent throughout the world, according to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/ataglance/glance.shtml">BBC.</a>   </p>
            

            <p>Many different sects of Hinduism exist, however, and it is difficult to find beliefs that all Hindus share, Brian Collins, the Drs. Ram and Sushila Gawande chair in Indian religion and philosophy, said.  </p>
        
            <p>“For the most part, all Hindus recognize the authority of the Vedas (sacred scriptures in Hinduism) as the ultimate authority of revelation,” Collins, who teaches Hinduism as well as other courses about religion, said. “For the most part, they all worship, engage and celebrate the festivals and the rights of at least one of the Hindu gods.” </p>

            <p>Swati Roy, a sophomore studying international business, said Hinduism differs from person to person based on individual beliefs, and people pray by themselves whenever they need to.</p>
            
            <p>“It’s a personal opinion,” Prashant Kumar Kuntala, the president of Indian Students Association, said. “You’re a Hindu, but it’s up to you how much you want to spend praying. It’s a personal choice.” </p>
            

            <p>Roy said some Hindus do not believe there is a specific god or way of worship. </p>
        
            <p>“Some just believe that religion is just a way of life,” Roy said. “You just do good deeds, and good deeds come back to you. You just pray to a divine energy. It doesn’t have to be a specific god or a specific idol that you worship.”
            </p>
            
             <blockquote class="pq_right">
                 “I feel that if you are in those classes or in those majors as a Republican, you can feel very not able to say what you want to say."
            <span class="attribution">Ryan Evans, president of Ohio University College Repulicans</span>
        </blockquote>

            <p>Roy’s beliefs are different from her parents, which she said is common among many younger people who are Hindu.

            </p>
            

            <p>“I don’t know which Hindus are really religious,” Roy, who is from Dhaka, Bangladesh, said. “Because every time I meet someone, if they’re from this generation, it’s very hard to find someone who’s really religious.” </p>
            
        
        
            <p>In 2014, 26 percent of Hindus in the U.S. said religion is “very important” to them, compared  45 percent of Hindus in 2007 according to the <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/u-s-public-becoming-less-religious/">Pew Research Center.</a>  </p>
            
            <p>The newer generation of Hindus does not have as many mandatory customs to pray every day as previous generations did, Roy said, which is why younger Hindus may not practice and go to temple as much as their parents do. </p>
            
            <p>Roy said she knows many Hindus who worship or pray because their parents want them to, even if they are not personally spiritual. 
  </p>
            
            
            
            <p>“When someone just asks you out of the blue ‘What’s your religion?’ you identify yourself with your parents’ religion just because it becomes too intense to tell someone that I’m an atheist and don’t believe in anything,” Roy said. “It’s just easier to say you’re Hindu.”</p>
            
            <p>Roy said she does not like labels but would consider herself more of an agnostic atheist, although her parents are still very religious.  </p>
            
            
            <p>Nitin Luthra, a first-year graduate student studying English, said he is not as religious as his parents. </p>
            
            <p>“I’m not really religious, but I’m very spiritual,” Luthra, who is from Delhi, India, said. “I used to go for yoga and meditation every morning. Yoga is a very important part of people’s lives. It’s like, everywhere in India.”
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subhed" id="sectionname">Worship in Athens</h2>
            
                <blockquote class="pq_left">
                 “Studying American politics as an international student is tough because if you live in America, you are raised on politics. You are raised knowing what the Constitution is. … Not having that background before entering the college setting is difficult."
            <span class="attribution">Amal Afyouni, sophomore studying economics and political science</span>
        </blockquote>
            
            <p>Having no place of worship in Athens, Hindus have found alternate ways to worship. </p>
            
            <p>“Hindu students are in and out, and the settled community here has not grown to the place where they’re investing in (a Hindu place of worship),” Collins said.
            </p>
            
            <p>When it comes to debates or conversations in class, Afyouni said she tries to come in with an open mind.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>“I try to keep (debates) cordial as much as I can,” Afyouni said. “I believe the best way to have a functioning politics is to be civil and acknowledge other people’s views.”</p>
            
            <p>There are certain topics that she won’t shy away from just because she’s Arab-American. That’s her advice: “Don’t ever feel like you can’t say something or you may be rejected because everyone is going to get rejected either way.”</p>
            
            <p>Burgess said international students add an “interesting perspective” to her classroom discussions.
            </p>
            
            <p>“They have a different take on U.S. politics and so forth, not having spent their whole lives within it,” Burgess said. “It’s interesting to have the interaction between people who have grown up within the system and people who have not. ... It adds a layer to the conversation that, really, I think provides additional understanding for both groups.”

            <p>Dan West, assistant professor and John A. Cassese director of forensics in the School of Communication Studies, has a background in debating. He said professors can play the role of a moderator and acts as a referee of a debate held in the classroom. He can’t carry that role out in his classes of 400 people — but in class with 20 to 30 people, that’s more doable. </p>
            
            
            
            <p>“I think the teacher can play a very valuable role as to moderating (classroom discussions), which is to evaluate the statements and the arguments,” West said. “Student A gets up and makes a statement. As a teacher, I can go, ‘That’s a claim. What’s your data and what’s your logic behind that, or your reasoning behind that, your warrant?’ I can say that without malice and without judging.”
            </p>
            
            <p>He can point out logical fallacies and evaluate what students are saying, which causes students observing the discussion to start to think and speak critically.
            </p>
            
            <p>West said when students are going back and forth with those who might hold a differing opinion, it’s important for students to think about how they would want to be treated — and attacking isn’t a the right way to do that. Listening is key.
            </p>
            

            <p>“You have to realize you’re probably not going to change their mind,” West said. “Debating someone is not going to make them change their mind.”</p>
            
            <p>In smaller class setting, Evans said he has an easier time discussing his opinion on politics — something that’s expected in political science classes. </p>
            
            <p>Sam said she tries to be transparent on her viewpoints and how they affect her political leanings. She said today’s society still considers politics a taboo subject.  </p>

        </blockquote>
            
            <p>“I think (politics are) something that should be talked about openly, and we understand that people are going to feel differently, but I also think that there’s ways that you can present it that can be a little bit more persuasive so that maybe people tend to see your point a little bit more. That’s why I’m very open about things because maybe if they … know someone that this has affected, then they in turn might be a little more open to seeing it from my side.”</p>
            
            
            <p>Jerry said he wants to see students learn how to understand each other. </p>
            
            <p>“(I want students to take away) an understanding of the other — the other ideas and the other positions. I don’t necessarily think the classroom is a venue for persuasion because it certainly isn’t. You’re presenting information,” Jerry said. “But, having an understanding of how individuals can look at that information and come to different conclusions, I think, is a first step toward respect and maybe at some point, realizing that there’s a need for collaboration and cooperation.”</p>
            
            <p>Overall, learning the context and the basics as well as how to talk politics is something that can be moved beyond a classroom, Burgess said. 
            </p>
            
            <p>“Hopefully people can take (what they learn) out of the classroom and work on political community in a broader context,” Burgess said.
