        <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he day was Aug. 4, Bobcat Media Day at Peden Stadium, and the Ohio linebackers had their annual funny picture to take.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Last year the group did a cheerleader pyramid, but this season would have a different picture. With Austin Clack on one end and James Leyden on the other, the group locked hands and jumped in the air together as it mimicked a group of sorority sisters.</p>
        
        
        
    <div class="oneimg_center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" align=center>

<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Each player wore a smile or showed some form of amusement &mdash; Chad Moore and Cody Grilliot stuck out their tongues.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">The Ohio linebackers are silly, but they&rsquo;re proud of that.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">It&rsquo;s an identity the group has created among the team, and, because of that, the players in the unit aren&rsquo;t afraid to be themselves.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never a dull moment with the linebackers,&rdquo; junior Evan Croutch said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">The linebacker meetings are not boring. The group designates a player to begin most meetings with a riddle. Dylan Conner has been that designated player lately, and the rest of the Bobcats have tried to figure the riddles out.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Mundaneness is certainly not evident in this group. Moore and Quentin Poling crack jokes minutes before games, but when it&rsquo;s time to play, they&rsquo;re serious.</p>
          <blockquote class="pq_right">“A lot of different personalities, but all those personalities kind of gel together good.”<span class="attribution">Cody Grilliot  </span></blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">The group&rsquo;s capability to balance having fun with being serious puts it in position to perform well on the field.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">&ldquo;Leading up to it (a game), though, you gotta relax, not get all tense,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;Because when you do, that&rsquo;s sort of when you do mistakes, get nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">The Bobcats are around one another frequently, whether it&rsquo;s in meetings, on the field or even at home. Moore and Poling live together in an apartment. And last Sunday, the group &mdash; save for Jacob Koons, who was attending a birthday dinner for his mother &mdash; went to Croutch&rsquo;s house for dinner.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Croutch was on the charcoal grill with Grilliot, and, though Grilliot is a respected cook, it was the first time the group saw Croutch on the grill. Moore said the hamburgers and bratwursts were good.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s kind of hard to mess up a hamburger and brat, that&rsquo;s the way I look at it,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;Cook a steak for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Along with eating burgers and brats, the group played cornhole and table tennis to end the weekend. The players took a break from football and studying, continuing to foster their close-knit culture.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Linebackers coach and co-defensive coordinator Ron Collins and his wife, Sharon, occasionally have the unit over for dinner at their house, too.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Chemistry &mdash; whether on the field, in meetings or both &mdash; is important for the Bobcats. Some players could legitimately not like one another. But that&rsquo;s not the case for Ohio.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some guys that have not been good in there (the meeting room), and so it just makes the whole thing a little sour,&rdquo; Collins said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Collins wants a multitude of personalities in his group. He doesn&rsquo;t want guys who are &ldquo;cookie cutters,&rdquo; or players who don&rsquo;t show their true selves. For the redshirt freshmen, showing their true selves didn&rsquo;t come immediately last season.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">They were shy and sat straight-faced in meetings while the older linebackers cracked jokes.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">Eventually, though, the young linebackers started to crack jokes, too.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">&ldquo;They kind of finally realized that this is how it is,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;To just be able to get through football, you gotta have some comedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">And comedy is a surplus for the linebackers. The group even has nicknames for one another.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">One day, Moore was looking at Conner and called him a &ldquo;Berry.&rdquo; Eric Popp is called &ldquo;Popsicle,&rdquo; and Jared Dorsa is called &ldquo;Meat Sauce.&rdquo; The latter is because one day, Moore and some linebackers saw him in a dining hall with a bunch of meat sauce on his spaghetti.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">And then Dorsa was also given the nickname &ldquo;Mustard&rdquo; because he had a hotdog with an absurd amount of mustard on it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">In addition, Grilliot is called &ldquo; &lsquo;Squatch&rdquo; because he has a lot of hair. Marcus Brunson is called &ldquo;Dolphin&rdquo; because he likes dolphins &mdash; he also has a snake.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">While the linebackers aren&rsquo;t afraid to show their personalities, they are not averse to being serious as well. The lively meetings, the funny nicknames &mdash; those things contribute to the group&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">But when it&rsquo;s time to be serious, the Bobcats are. And that&rsquo;s why their goofiness isn&rsquo;t looked down upon.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;">&ldquo;I think we just have a lot of really good leadership in the room,&rdquo; Grilliot said. &ldquo;A lot of different personalities, but all those personalities kind of gel together good.&rdquo;</p>
