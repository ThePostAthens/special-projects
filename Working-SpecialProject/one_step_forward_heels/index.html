            <p>The senior studying •international business and marketing said she feels powerful when she puts them on. She wore heels almost everyday of her summer internship with •Sport Inspired, switching between the •five pairs she brought to her program in London. She even bought •two more pairs while there.</p>

            <p>“I didn’t mind,” she said.</p></div>
        
        <div class="column20center">
            <p>With an extensive history, heels can still stand as a symbol of power and fashion, despite the pain and injury that can be associated with the heightened style. </p>

            <p>A high heel can be defined in a variety of ways, depending on its style. For example, according to •Steve Madden’s •<a class="link" href="http://www.stevemadden.com/content.jsp?pageName=ShoeGlossary" target="_blank">“Glossary of Shoe Types, Materials, and Construction,”</a> stilettos have higher, thinner heels with the heel itself tapering in width toward the ground, although kitten heels are about 1 to 2 inches in height. Wedges are also classified as a high heel, though the sole covers the entire foot rather than just supporting the heel.</p>
            

            <p>There is more that goes into the footwear than just simply slipping on a pair. </p>

                <p>Dr. Jeff Russell is able to see the science behind the shoes. Russell is the director of Ohio University’s SHAPe (<a class="link" href="https://www.ohio.edu/chsp/ahsw/about/community/shape-clinic.cfm" target="_blank">Science and Health in Artistic Performance</a>) Clinic, working specifically with •performing artists.</p></div>

        <div class="column20center">
            <p>He works with dancers who use •pointe shoes, a type of ballet footwear with a flat toe, which dancers stand directly on. That position, called •en pointe, is the “farthest, most extreme position (a ballerina) can be when she’s pointing her foot.”
            </p>

            <p>Slightly less extreme are two positions called •demi-pointe and •three-quarter pointe, which are both similar to the position the foot is in while wearing high heels, specifically stilettos — it is not directly on the toes, but on the heads of the •metatarsals, or toe bones.</p>
      
            
        
     
        <div class="oneimg_right">

            <p class="photog">Cidney Kelly / Photo Illustration</p></div>
        
            <p>“Your entire weight is coming down through that foot, and it’s those metatarsals … that are taking much of that weight,” Russell said. “Over time, you can build up a stress fracture because you’re putting so much load on those foot bones, and the forces are transmitted up through the bones and in areas where (the bones) are weak.”</p>
        
            <p>That position can cause the •Achilles tendon to shorten, so Russell recommends •stretching one’s feet after wearing heels so they do not remain that way permanently.</p>
            
            <p>According to a study published by the •University of Alabama at Birmingham in •May 2015, more than •123,000 injuries related to wearing heels were treated across •100 emergency departments in the United States between •2002 and •2012 — with the highest affected age category being •20- to 29-year-olds.
            </p>
            
          
            
            <p>Wearing heels also creates •less balance, as the support surface is in a more peculiar shape than it would be in a pair of tennis shoes. The center of gravity also then is disrupted and “goes up and comes forward,” Russell said.
            </p>
            
            <p>“Basically, your pelvis tips forward, and you have more lower back curvature than normal, and that can put a lot of stress on your low back. It’s basically like walking downhill all the time,” Russell said. “So, if you think about walking downhill all the time, it can be very uncomfortable on your low back because you’re wanting to fall forward because you’re on a slope. … In order to keep yourself from falling forward, your body naturally responds by curving your lower back more to help stabilize you.”
            </p>
            
            <p>And when it comes to actually going downhill — something that comes with the Athens terrain — Russell was pretty clear in his recommendations. </p>
            
            <p>“Walking downhill in stiletto heels — that’s not a good plan,” Russell said. “You will wreck yourself.”
            </p>
            
            <p>Russell said there should be an understanding of the science behind such extreme shoes, and he recommends paying attention to the pain caused by them, if it does occur. </p>

                </div>
            
            <p>“Your body has pain for a purpose,” Russell said. “It’s supposed to be a signal to you, and you’re supposed to listen to it. So, if something is a little uncomfortable because your shoes don’t fit right ... something that’s not a big problem — that’s one thing.</p>
            
            <p>“But when you start having pain, that’s a signal you should listen to, and you need to do something about that and have yourself looked at by someone who understands the foot and the ankle and the injuries to it.”</p>

            <p>Marissa •Santiago-Meyers, a sophomore studying English and Spanish, said she has avoided pain by having her family •teach her how to walk in high heels, rather than putting on her first pair of pumps right before a school dance.</p>
            
            
            <p>“I was taught how to walk in them from a … younger (age),” she said, adding that she owns about •40 pairs of heels. “You definitely have to build up in height. My mom was super strict on that when we were growing up. We couldn’t get super tall ones when we were, like, 14. She made us go through the steps in the inches.”</p>
            
            
            <p>Holub learned how to walk properly in heels by attending •modeling etiquette school.
“We had to wear them eight hours a day,” she said. </p>

            <p>Erika• Peyton, •assistant director for employer relations and marketing at the •Career and Leadership Development Center at OU, said she likes to wear heels because she feels it dresses up an outfit. According to an article from the •<a class="link" href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/high-heels-workplace-can-employers-still-require-women-to-wear-them" target="_blank">National Law Review</a>, however, businesses cannot •demand women wear heels unless the same expectation is given to men under •Title VII of the •Civil Rights Act. Under that, it is illegal to discriminate based on •race, color, sex, religion or national origin.  
</p>

            <p>When attending career fairs or interviews, the question may be whether or not to put on a pair of high heels to fit conservative, corporate standards. Peyton said dress codes all depend on the industry and type of company, but there is one thing for all applicants to keep in mind.</p>

            <p>“What we recommend to students if they do chose to wear heels is it really should be something that you can comfortably walk in — they shouldn’t be a distraction,” Peyton said. “We always want the content of a student’s experience, the content of their character to be the focus, not the fact that they’re wearing heels that are an encumbrance.”</p>
        
            
            <p>•Finance and corporate law were two industries where Peyton said people generally dress •“business professional,” and suits are expected. But even in everyday dress outside of the office, heels are not the norm for most, and it has been that way since the •1950s, said •Trina Gannon, an •adjunct instructor at OU with degrees in clothing and retail with a focus on history and anthropology. </p>

            <p>Gannon said high heels started out as platform sandals, which royalty would wear. The shoes were intended to make the elite stand out, and throughout history, people would follow the standards set by royalty.</p>
            
            <p>Gannon said even modern •tennis shoes and •dress shoes still have a bit of •added height for men who may not wear higher heels.</p>
            
            <p>“Women’s shoes became more of a focus of fashion during probably sometime in the late 1700s when women’s hemlines shortened a little bit,” Gannon said. “But when women’s hemlines lengthen, that’s when shoes become a little more plain, a little more dull.”
Heel height can also change in response to war and times of national conflict, such as the period following •9/11. </p>
            
            <div class="heel_respons"><img class="heel_image" src="img/heels/wedge.svg" style="padding-bottom: 5.5%; padding-top: 12%;"> <div class="heel_icon"></div> <div class="heels_text"><p>Text here about shoes because shoes are super cool yay I love heels</p></div>
                </div>
            
            <p>“In times of conflict, not only do women’s clothing become more subtle, but their shoe heel shortens,” Gannon said. “So, like in times of conflict, like in World War II, the heel was an average •1 1/2- to •2-inches high. In the late ’90s, if you look at what was trending for women, it was stiletto high heels, the •4- or •5-inch heels; after •9/11, it went straight back down to •2-inch heels.”</p>

            <p>The style today has transitioned back to higher heels and wedges. In Athens specifically, business owners sell heels throughout the year. •Marissa Whaley, store manager of •Bluetique on •West State Street, said the beginnings of •Fall and •Spring Semesters are when she most often sees people coming in to buy heels. The store’s most popular-selling heel depends on •what is in style. </p>
            
            <p>“Comfort is never really an option,” Whaley said of what customers want in a pair of heels. “It’s whatever looks cute with an outfit.”</p>
            
            <p>April• Almond, manager of •The Other Place on •Court Street, said the store tries not to stock particularly high heels. •Lynsey Long, a •sales associate at The Other Place, said the store sells a lot of •TOMS wedges due to their comfort.

            <p>Holub said she has experienced •blisters when breaking in a new pair. However, Holub said when it comes to purchasing high heels, she buys •higher-quality shoes, which she said makes the shoes more comfortable. </p>

            <p>Even with the pain and the injuries associated, though, people still purchase and put on heels.
“I think a lot of women in general wear heels because it makes them hold themselves in a different way,” Gannon said. “It’s like an alternate personality-type thing. You go out at night, you’re a different person than you are during the day.”</p>
            
            <p>Gannon said she started wearing heels more frequently when she started teaching, living by the old adage that she should “dress for the job you want, not the job you have.”
Santiago-Meyers said people should wear what makes them feel the best. For her, that is a pair of heels.</p>
            
            <p>“You get more confidence, I think,” Santiago-Meyers said. “It just makes you feel all put-together. … I always feel way more confident in a pair of heels. It changes your walk. It changes the way you stand.”</p>
            
            <p>And for Holub, it can be as simple as others knowing that she is passing by.
            </p>
            
            <p>“I like the sound,” Holub said. “I like being taller.” </p>
