        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he beginning of a new school year is, for many, a time of excitement and new beginnings. But for freshmen stepping onto a new campus for the first time, the transition into college life can be a stressful, if not anxiety-inducing, experience.</p>
        <p>Students seeking counseling can turn to a number of services on campus, most of which are run through Ohio University Counseling and Psychological Services. </p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">Drop-In Services</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>For immediate mental health needs, CPS offers drop-in services at its Hudson Health Center location. During those appointments, counselors are available to help patients create a plan of action to address pressing crises. </p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_right">
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/6084_5f4e4d235ee99e5f4dd8b9df0a80b9a6f.jpg">
            <p class="photog">Alex Driehaus | FILE</p><p class="pcut">Hudson Health Center, April 16, 2016.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Emergency appointments are available Monday through Friday from 9:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. </p>
        <p>If a crisis arises while CPS is closed, students are encouraged to contact 740-593-1616 to speak with a counselor via the 24/7 Crisis Intervention Service. Students can also contact the Ohio University Police Department at 740-593-1911. Those living in residence halls can receive help by contacting their resident assistant, who may contact a counselor-in-residence or a counselor-on-call.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">Individual Counseling</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>With a staff including clinical counselors, psychologists and graduate students in-training, CPS offers individual counseling sessions </p>
        <p>To begin individual counseling, students must first attend drop-in hours for an initial contact appointment, during which the student will be evaluated and referred to a counselor who will answer questions the student has. </p>
        <p>During a typical counseling session, students will speak about the issues they are facing while a counselor listens, asks questions and works to help the student address questions and provide guidance. </p>
        <p>Under the WellBeing Plan, OU students can use up to 20 counseling sessions per academic year. The WellBeing Plan is a payment students can make that helps reduce the cost of OU healthcare services. A $20 fee will be charged for missing an appointment or failing to cancel within 24 hours of the scheduled time.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">Group Counseling</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>CPS also offers group therapy sessions during which a group of six to eight individuals meets face-to-face with a therapist who specializes in group therapy. During a typical session, individuals talk about their stressors with a focus on self-disclosing or revealing one&rsquo;s feelings to other members of the group. </p>
        <p>The first sessions, which serve as an introduction to group therapy, focus on fostering trust with other group members to create an environment conducive to the discussion of personal issues. </p>
        <p>Group therapy sessions are covered by the OU WellBeing fee and do not count toward the 20 session limit.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">Psychiatric Consultation</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>Students looking to see a psychiatrist, who is authorized to write prescriptions for various mental health disorders, must be referred through their drop-in or assigned counselors at CPS. </p>
        <p>With only one full-time psychiatrist on staff, CPS warns <a href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/04/mental-health-ohio-services" style="color: #67b6e5">wait times</a> for care may stretch from four to six weeks during the peak demand for services, which typically occurs later in Fall Semester.</p>
        <p>Students are also advised to partake in a physical exam before seeing a psychiatrist to rule out medical illnesses. CPS also encourages students to have another provider off-campus or at home to see during breaks, after graduation or in case the campus psychiatrist is not available.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">"Let's Talk" Sessions</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>The Living Learning Center, located on South Green, offers walk-in &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk&rdquo; hours for students seeking counseling outside of CPS&rsquo; regular operating hours. <br />The sessions are offered Sunday through Friday from 5 to 10 p.m. in room 160 of the LLC. </p>
