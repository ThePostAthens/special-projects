        <p>The only disappointment came at the very end.</p>
        <p>For a team rich with seniors and budding freshmen, Ohio didn&rsquo;t disappoint. The team climbed to the finals of the American Collegiate Hockey Association National Tournament before falling to Central Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>The trip to the national championship game marked the Bobcats&rsquo; first since the 2003-04 season. </p>
        <p>In the years since, they&rsquo;ve won no fewer than 65 percent of their games each season, but they always came up short in the single-elimination ACHA tournament.</p>
        <p>Though 10 seniors have departed, there is an expectation that another strong year lies ahead. Eight of the team&rsquo;s top-12 scorers are returning, including center Gianni Evangelisti, a rising sophomore.</p>
        <p>Evangelisti will most likely vault from a third-line center to the top line next season, as the two senior centers in front of him have graduated. He finished with 32 points in 28 games &mdash; third-best on the team &mdash; thanks in part to exceptional puck control and a combination of speed and skill.</p>
        <p>On the defensive side, rising sophomore Jake Houston is the best bet to run Ohio&rsquo;s top power play unit, as he did for most of his first season. Houston led all Bobcat defensemen in assists and points and was named a finalist for ACHA National Rookie of the Year.</p>
        <div class="oneimg_full"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/18207_hockeyf.jpg" alt="ACHA National Tournament" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Blake Nissen | FILE</p><p class="pcut">Joe Breslin works his way down the ice during Ohio's game against The University of Oklahoma durig the ACHA National Tournament.</p> </div>

        <p>While Ohio coach Sean Hogan will probably add two goalies to his upcoming freshman class, he appears to have found his starter for the foreseeable future in Jimmy Thomas. </p>
        <p>Despite entering last season&rsquo;s practices behind seniors Aaron Alkema and Ryan Heltion &mdash; who had combined to start more than 90 percent of Ohio&rsquo;s games the previous three seasons &mdash; Thomas rose to the starting role.</p>
        <p>He finished his first year with a 13-4-1 record, a 2.38 goals-against average, a .890 save percentage and three shutouts in 19 games.</p>
        <p>Ohio dominated most opponents last season, losing two games in a row just twice in 37 games. For all the players the Bobcats lost, many contributors are returning. </p>
        <p>Not to mention that this past year&rsquo;s freshman class was Hogan&rsquo;s strongest in three years, which suggests that next year&rsquo;s group may follow suit.</p>
        <p>The captain leadership, a topic Hogan stresses, should be a non-issue once again. The players unanimously selected defenseman Jake Faiella as their captain, with defenseman Grant Hazel and forward Mike Palasics set to serve as assistants. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to be selected as captain of the Ohio Hockey program by my teammates,&rdquo; Faiella said in a statement released by the team. &ldquo;I am excited about the upcoming season and feel we have a special group that has an opportunity at success.&rdquo;</p>
