        <p>Welcome to campus, Bobcats! Attending orientation and exploring a college campus is probably pretty new for many of you. But the great part is that college is all about new experiences. You will meet new people, learn new material and experience life away from home. It can be a bit intimidating, but don&rsquo;t worry too much because everyone will make mistakes along the way.</p>
        
        <p>You will probably end up walking into the wrong classroom or turning in an assignment late. You might have an argument with a roommate or feel incredibly homesick at some point. But take a moment and relax, because it is going to turn out OK.</p>
        <p>Athens and Ohio University have a lot to offer, so don&rsquo;t shy away from trying something new. Work hard, step out of your comfort zone and find out what college has to offer. Again, you will mess up, but there is always some room for a little failure. Learn from the mistakes you make and move on.</p>
        <p>But if you are stressing a bit, here is some advice.</p>
        <p>Take classes that interest you. Even try out a few of the less traditional classes, such as one about wilderness skills or the paranormal. Also, definitely go to class. You&rsquo;ll meet some interesting people and hopefully learn a thing or two.</p>
        <p>Venture outside of your freshman dorm room to explore what OU and Athens have to offer. Do the typical college thing and hammock on College Green or catch a frisbee. Try new cuisine Uptown that you have never heard of before. Hike up Bong Hill and attend a sporting event (even if you don&rsquo;t particularly like sports). Discover your favorite spot in Athens, spend some time studying in Alden Library and check out some of the local bands playing on the weekends.</p>
        <p>But do not be afraid to spend a night in too. Gather with some floormates and watch your favorite Disney movies. Make some popcorn and relax every once in awhile.</p>
        <p>Find your niche. If you join an organization that you care about, you are likely to meet some like-minded people. Try an intramural sport, a music group or the independent student media outlet, <em>The Post</em>. If you are doing what you love, you are on the right path.</p>
        <p>No matter what you do in college, <em>The Post</em> will be here documenting all the exciting and crazy moments you experience. Stay up to date by following <em>The Post </em>and some of our reporters on social media. Also, sign up for <a href="http://thepostathens.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=202ce2225503286b8f1a88441&amp;id=aac70e7d6c" style="color: #f4801f">our daily newsletter, Post Haste,</a> to receive the latest news in your inbox every morning.</p>
        <p>When you return to campus in the fall, stop by Baker 325 to say hello to some Posties and pick up a new issue of <em>The Post </em>from a newsstand every Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>Enjoy Athens, and good luck.</p>
