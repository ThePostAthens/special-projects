        <p><p><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo years ago, a battle occurred between Derrius Vick and JD Sprague. A year ago, Quinton Maxwell took on with Greg Windham. </p>
        <p>Those have been Ohio&rsquo;s two quarterback battles of the past two years. And this year, Maxwell, the presumptive starting quarterback, does not have his job fully secure. </p>
        <p>Maxwell will battle with Nathan Rourke, a rising junior quarterback who transferred from Fort Scott Community College in Kansas. A Canada native, Rourke began to show why he could compete for the starting job during spring practice. </p>
        <p>Rourke began the spring season learning the Bobcats&rsquo; offense, but as the season wore on, he started to make improvements. His reads became sharper, his throws more precise. </p>
        <p>Though Rourke began to improve, he still showed a flaw near the end of spring practice. When throwing across the middle, Rourke seemingly would overlook a safety or other defensive back across the secondary, and the safety would often intercept his passes. It&rsquo;s important to remember, he&rsquo;s still new to the offense. </p>
        <p>Rourke still has time in fall camp to make improvements, but that means the other half of the battle, Maxwell, does too. </p>
        <p>Last season, Maxwell took the starting job away from former quarterback Greg Windham. Windham&rsquo;s production began to dip during the middle of the season, and Maxwell earned the first start of his collegiate career last October against Kent State University. </p>
        <p>Maxwell threw for 1,247 yards and eight touchdowns during his redshirt freshman season. </p>
        <p>Aside from those two quarterbacks both having legitimate shots at being the starter, Ohio likes to have two quarterbacks ready throughout the season. That&rsquo;s not unusual; it&rsquo;s simply about being prepared. </p>
        <p>If one quarterback goes down because of injury, then the next one can enter the starting role seamlessly. </p>
        <p>But perhaps Ohio doesn&rsquo;t mind having a minor quarterback battle for a reason other than being prepared: The Bobcats simply love the competition. </p>
        <p>Maxwell is the favorite to win the job, and with his strong work ethic, he probably will. But Rourke will be waiting to rise, because for Ohio, a quarterback always is.</p>
