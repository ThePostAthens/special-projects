        <p>With approximately 24,000 total students on Ohio University&rsquo;s campus, students are bound to see some pretty cool things during their time in Athens. Here are some of the best places to observe others on and near campus:</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">Athens County Courthouse</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>The Athens County Courthouse, 1 S. Court St., is located right in the middle of Court Street, making it a prime people-watching location. Throughout the year, the area in front of the courthouse is the site of many protests spearheaded by local activists due to its central location.</p>
        <p>Benches wrap around the trees between the courthouse and the Athens County Board of Elections, where Athens resident Kayla Graham sat and watched the cars and people pass by on Court Street.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I live right down the road,&rdquo; Graham said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice day, so might as well. I just like to watch people.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Another bonus is that it is free to sit at the location, Graham said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you sit at any other place, you have to eat there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">Tables outside Court Street restaurants</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>Some local businesses on Court Street, such as <a href="http://www.brenens.com/" style="color: #67b6e5">Brenen&rsquo;s Coffee Cafe</a> and <a href="http://www.whitsathens.com/Whits_Custard_Of_Athens/Whits_Menu.html" style="color: #67b6e5">Whit&rsquo;s Frozen Custard</a>, have tables outside where students will often sit if the weather is nice enough. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;We sat outside because it&rsquo;s such a nice day out, and it&rsquo;s nice to take a break from studying and projects and all that,&rdquo; Jane Dickerson, a rising junior studying graphic design, said while she sat outside Brenen&rsquo;s Coffee Cafe.</p>
        <p>Certain days are better for people-watching than others, including Fests and HallOUween.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We were sitting here by the window on Palmer Place Fest, and people were just running around super drunk outside taking pictures and wearing weird stuff,&rdquo; Dickerson said. &ldquo;That was pretty funny.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>If they&rsquo;re really lucky, students will be blessed with the presence of a furry friend scampering down the street with its owner.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I love dog watching,&rdquo; Dickerson said. &ldquo;Definitely the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#67b6e5">College Green</font></h2></div>
        
        <p>College Green is the hub of OU. For more than 200 years, students have enjoyed the shady trees and brick sidewalks. When the weather is nice, students can be spotted swinging in a hammock doing homework, picnicking on blankets or sunbathing on College Green.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like seeing all the people out,&rdquo; Carly Rankin, a rising senior studying biology, said while she sat at the Civil War Monument. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of my favorite things about Athens. When it&rsquo;s nice out, all these people are just congregated all the time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Evan Schmidt, an OU alumnus, laid back on a picnic blanket on College Green eating Chipotle with some friends. He said that was one of his favorite things to do in Athens.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;(College Green) is the eclectic college feel of everyone hanging out on grass whenever they want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most stereotypical college feel in Athens.&rdquo;</p>
