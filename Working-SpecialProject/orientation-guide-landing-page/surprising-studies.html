        <p>The traditional college experience usually includes subjects like science and literature, but most students are unaware of other weird classes that are offered.</p>

        <p>Karl Schmidt, a graduate student studying recreation and sport sciences, teaches a two-week course called Wilderness Living Skills. The class covers basic backpacking skills that help students enjoy nature more.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The students get a taste of living out of a backpack and carrying everything that they own,&rdquo; Schmidt said.</p>
        <p>Some students may not read the syllabus before coming to class, Schmidt said. The students believe the course teaches them how to survive with no supplies like televised British adventurer <a href="http://www.beargrylls.com/" style="color: #a12F5e">Bear Grylls</a>. Most of Schmidt&rsquo;s students don&rsquo;t have previous experience with outdoor recreation.</p>
        <p>Schmidt said they&rsquo;ll learn common knowledge, such as how to ration supplies, manage a group and read terrain. His students will have some mastery of the backpacking skills and be able to perform a few blindfolded by the end of the course, he said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The goal is that the skills become second-nature,&rdquo; Schmidt said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re able to perform skills at a much faster rate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Schmidt also hopes that students not in applicable majors can take away valuable skills such as how to keep a group under control.</p>
        <p>OU also has other classes that have a normal class structure but cover unique topics.</p>
        <p>Brian Collins, the Drs. Ram and Sushila Gawande Chair in Indian Religion and Philosophy, teaches a summer class called The Global Occult: Ghosts, Demonology, and the Paranormal in World Religions.</p>
        <p>Collins said he wanted a course that students couldn&rsquo;t take online. He wants them to enjoy the class readings and participate in discussions. Collins said he looks forward to any stories that might be shared including experiences playing with a Ouija board.</p>
        <p>Some topics covered in The Global Occult include Satanism, demonology and exorcism.</p>
        <p>A part of Collins&rsquo; class will include guest speakers. He has an Ouija board expert and an exorcism practitioner, among others, visit as guest speakers. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Some of them I know personally,&rdquo; Collins said. &ldquo;They (will) do (a Skype Q&amp;A) as a favor to me. I&rsquo;ve contacted some people and asked them to call in. Most of them have been happy to do it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Collins said other classes he has taught covered some of those paranormal topics, but he wants to explore them in more detail. When someone studies a religion, they can&rsquo;t ignore those topics without causing a blind spot, he said. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;These are practices that are not associated with a small minority of people, but with huge numbers of people &hellip; (who) count these beliefs and traditions among their religious life,&rdquo; Collins said.</p>
        <p>In both Wilderness Living Skills and The Global Occult classes, there&rsquo;s a focus on keeping some aspects local or discussing local history.</p>
        <p>Schmidt said he usually takes his Wilderness Living Skills students on a weekend trip to Zaleski State Forest at the end of the course. They will complete a well-maintained 23-mile backpacking loop.</p>
        <p>He enjoys taking students to this location since it&rsquo;s a 30-minute drive from Athens, and they can take their friends there.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important that &hellip; we highlight outdoor resources that are in Ohio,&rdquo; Schmidt said. &ldquo;When you talk about outdoor recreation, every single time, students will want to go to Kentucky or &hellip; Pennsylvania or West Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>One topic Collins&rsquo; Global Occult class will discuss is the ghosts in Athens.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It would be crazy to ignore the fact that (Athens) is one of the hubs of spiritualism in the 19th century,&rdquo; Collins said.</p>
        <p>Some classes at OU may cover odd material. However, the instructors don&rsquo;t want students to put less importance on those classes, Collins said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is an odd class, admittedly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think odd means pointless.&rdquo;</p>
