            <p>Geena Provenzano describes her style as “extra.”</p>
            
            <p>“I feel like I’m very monochromatic, but I like having a statement piece with that,” Provenzano, a freshman studying journalism, said.</p>
            
            <p>Provenzano was voted by her peers as the Post Pick for Most Fashionable, and it’s quite easy to see why.</p>
            
            <p>“I think the best way to put it, is that she makes everyone look average,” Annie Kautz, a freshman studying photography, said.</p>
            
            <p>Provenzano, who is from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area, has been interested in fashion since she was a toddler and could be found going through her mother’s closet putting together outfits.</p>
            
            <p>Provenzano now puts her fashion insight on a blog called <a href="https://psychonicstyle.wordpress.com/">Psychonic Style</a>. On the site, she writes about trends she’s interested in, current fashion news and shows off looks of her own.</p>
            
            <p>“I do lookbooks of what I wear and how I pair certain things, and then I’ll do trends I’m currently obsessed with and where to buy certain things that are trendy now,” Provenzano said.</p>
            
            <p>She also created a Christmas list on her blog, as well as anniversary picks for Nordstrom’s Anniversary Sale.</p>
            
            <p>“I work at Nordstrom, so I shop there a lot because (of the) discounts, and I like how they have a little bit of everything,” Provenzano said. “I shop at Free People a lot because I like all of their bohemian sort of different things, and Urban Outfitters, too, for the same reason.”</p>
            
            <p>Provenzano finds inspiration from other people’s blogs, as well as social media sites such as Instagram. Her favorite places to find new looks are reality television shows like Project Runway.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="pq_center">“I feel like (fashion is) its own artform in a way. I think it’s one of the best ways to express individuality.”<span class="attribution">– Geena Provenzano</span></blockquote>

            
            <p>“I’m in a group in Pittsburgh that’s a blogger group, so I look at (their blogs) a lot,” Provenzano said. “I think Instagram is big because of the pictures. You can see the outfits easily.”</p>
            
            <p>One of Provenzano’s biggest inspirations is Rachel Zoe, who is a fashion designer, writer and businesswoman. She is a role model to Provenzano because she was one of the first people she saw with a similar job that she wants in the industry.</p>
            
            <p>Provenzano is reluctant to say she finds inspiration in the stylings of the Kardashian family, but she said her closet is stocked with some similar items.</p>
            
            <p>“I don’t want to say the Kardashians because they’re not who I would think to be style inspiration,” Provenzano said. “But some of the clothes they wear I do see myself wearing, so I guess I take outfit inspiration from them.”</p>
            
            <p>Alessia Accordino, a freshman studying exercise physiology, admires the fact Provenzano is not afraid to stand out and be the most fashionable person in the room. </p>
            
            <p>“She just wants to look her best all the time and puts her best foot forward,” Accordino said.</p>
            
            <p>Provenzano’s dream job is to combine her passion for fashion and journalism experience to become the editor of <i>Vogue</i>, one of the most well-known fashion magazines in the world. </p>
            
            <p>“I feel like (fashion is) its own artform in a way,” Provenzano said. “I think it’s one of the best ways to express individuality.”</p>
