        <p>For Sadie Lamparyk&rsquo;s first year in <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show, </em>there is one part she is excited for:</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really looking forward to being in my underwear up on stage in front of a bunch of people.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>That is the thing about <em>Rocky</em> and the Lost Flamingo Company&rsquo;s staging of it. The night is just a group of sweaty people, decked out in glitter and lace, belting out the lyrics to &ldquo;Time Warp.&rdquo; Their corsets are tied, their thigh-highs secure and red lipstick has been carefully painted on their lips. And it is not just the cast &mdash; it is everyone. </p>

        <p>There are no expectations. There is not really a dress code. It is $5 at the door and a night in The Union Bar &amp; Grill,<strong> West Union Street, </strong>with 300 newly-made friends. </p>
        
        <div id="container">
      
            
        </div>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very liberating,&rdquo; Sasha Gough, an Athens resident who plays Dr. Scott, said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that you can&rsquo;t do besides be an asshole. You can walk around half-naked and everyone is kind of okay with it. There&rsquo;s no question.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The show is getting more notice nationally due to FOX&rsquo;s upcoming live remake of the show, starring Laverne Cox, Victoria Justice and Ryan McCartan. It airs on the same day LFC&rsquo;s show begins. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried it will affect our attendance or anything,&rdquo; Kelly Bergenstein, a senior studying sociology pre-law and director of the show, said. &ldquo;People can go watch it online the next day. Why would you not go support local art? Why would you not go see something that you won&rsquo;t be able to replay the next day? Like, it&rsquo;s not going to be on Netflix a few months from now. This is an experience, not just a show. And that&rsquo;s what we market to people.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>She said she&rsquo;ll give the remake a chance at a later time. She&rsquo;ll be focused that night on the show, which is based on a cult classic. Logan Amon, a junior studying child and family studies who is playing Dr. Frank-N-Furter, saw that movie for the first time after he already landed the part.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I actually hadn&rsquo;t seen the movie when I auditioned,&rdquo; Amon said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell them until we all did the cast viewing party. I was like, &lsquo;Hey, I haven&rsquo;t seen this.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

        <p>At first he thought it was &ldquo;wildly inappropriate for no reason,&rdquo; but now that he is in it, he understands it. </p>

        <p><strong>And so do the people in Athens. </strong>With lines that span the block outside of The Union, Bergenstein knows that her work does not go unnoticed. And it will not for her final year.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in our 15th year and it&rsquo;s such a staple in fall Athens culture and you don&rsquo;t want to be the person that messes that up,&rdquo; Bergenstein said. &ldquo;So, there was a lot of pressure when I first got started but now, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not so much about the performances. It&rsquo;s not so much about the show or the movie or the music &mdash; it&rsquo;s about the experience and if you get the experience right, that&rsquo;s what matters and I realized that that&rsquo;s what was happening. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I am having the time of my life. The people around me are having the time of their life. They feel supported. They feel like they&rsquo;re having fun, that this is worth their time. And they&rsquo;re excited to come to rehearsal everyday, they&rsquo;re excited to come back every fall. And just to see that every year, just rejuvenates me and it just keeps getting better.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><strong>THE PLOT:</strong></p>

        <p>Is known for being bizarre.</p>

        <p>Basically, engaged couple Brad and Janet are stuck in the middle of the forest after their car breaks down. They seek refuge in the mansion of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite mad scientist. They have a weird time meeting the cast of characters at the mansion, which includes his servants and his own man-made man, Rocky Horror. </p>

        <p>The original movie was released in 1975 and was directed by Jim Sharman. Tim Curry played the original Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Susan Sarandon played Janet and Barry Bostwick played Brad. </p>
        <p><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong></p>

        <p>The cast of LFC has been rehearsing since the beginning of the &nbsp;academic year. The original movie plays behind the cast, who acts out what is happening onscreen. That means they rehearse every movement the original actors are doing to be able to mimic them spot-on. </p>

        <p>ADD ONE LINE ABOUT VIRGIN SACRIFICES???</p>

        <p><strong>THE CALLBACKS:</strong></p>

        <p><em>Rocky Horror </em>is all about rituals &mdash; one aspects being the callbacks, where audience members become part of the dialogue. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;When you usually hear the word callback, it means in an audition, you&rsquo;re being &lsquo;called back&rsquo; to &hellip; (complete) another stage of the process,&rdquo; Darragh Liaskos, who is the assistant director, said.<strong> &ldquo;</strong>But in <em>Rocky, </em>there&rsquo;s a line and then the audience &lsquo;calls back&rsquo; onto stage what we&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo; </p>

        <p>The audience fills in natural pauses with phrases that make sense to the dialogue already happening &mdash; which can lead to a lot of shouting.</p>

        <p>An example:</p>

        <p>[Audience]: Do you know about gay sex?</p>

        <p>[Dr. Frank-N-Furter]: I have that knowledge. </p>

        <p><strong>ADVICE: </strong></p>

        <p><strong><em>If it is your first </em></strong><strong>Rocky, </strong><strong><em>the cast has some things they would like you to know:</em></strong></p>

        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to understand it. Don&rsquo;t try to understand it. Like, don&rsquo;t try to gain meaning from this movie. There is none. But also, come with an open mind and (be) ready to have fun. Just really embrace it.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Tess Plona, who is playing Janet</em></p>

        <p>&ldquo;Be a virgin. Embrace the virgin. Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re not a virgin when you really are.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Kate Keverline, who is playing Columbia</em></p>

        <p>&ldquo;Just come in with an open mind and an open wallet for the bar.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Jeralayne Ruiz, who is playing Magenta</em></p>

        <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell them anything because going to a <em>Rocky </em>show is 10 trillion times better when you have no idea what you&rsquo;re get into. That&rsquo;s how it was the first time I ever saw <em>Rocky</em> and it was so overwhelming so I would tell them nothing.&rdquo; &nbsp;&mdash; <em>Sarah DiFiore, who is in the Whorus</em></p>
