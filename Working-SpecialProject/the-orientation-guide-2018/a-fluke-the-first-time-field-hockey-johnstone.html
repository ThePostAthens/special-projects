        <p>When the idea of playing college field hockey was first brought to her attention, Ali Johnstone didn’t even know where Ohio was on a map.</p>
        
        <p>Now, Johnstone is familiar with Ohio — and Athens, in particular.</p>
        
        <p>Johnstone became the 11th head coach of the Ohio field hockey program after the athletic department “parted ways” with Neil Macmillan on Nov. 3.</p>
        
        <p>When Macmillan was let go, Johnstone was an assistant coaching at Northwestern; at the time, the Wildcats were playing Michigan in the Big Ten Tournament. She learned of the job opening from a barrage of text messages she received while on the team bus.</p>
        
        <p>But Johnstone and Northwestern were preparing for the NCAA Tournament, and she didn’t want to think about the Ohio job.</p>
        
        <p>The idea of coaching her alma mater was in her mind, but it wasn’t a goal of hers.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="pq_right">“When this position opened up, it was like the heavens opened and the sun came down, and all of a sudden it was like, ‘ah, it's meant to be,'”<span class="attribution">Ali Johnstone</span></blockquote>
        
        <p>Ohio made its decision quickly, offering Johnstone the position Nov. 8. But she still had to coach Northwestern in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
        
        <p>If an opportunity for her first head coaching job — at her alma mater, no less — was not enough to convince Johnstone to take the job, there was another incentive that might have convinced her: Johnstone’s wife, Laura Sowers, is from Logan and is an alumna, too.</p>
        
        <p>Johnstone was introduced to the team on Nov. 13, the day after Northwestern’s season ended.</p>
        
        <p>She signed a four-year contract worth $86,000 per year. Possible bonuses based on performance of the team were also part of the contract.</p>
        
        <p>It was a ‘fluke,’ Johnstone said, that she even came to Ohio to play college field hockey.</p>
        
        <p>At a national tournament in Canada, an Ohio coach approached her dad and gave him a business card. He thought it was funny, and Johnstone said no. Her goal was to make the Canadian National Team. The Delta, British Columbia, native had seen other people go to the U.S. and be shunned by the Canadian program.</p>
        
        <p>Once Johnstone made the junior Canadian National Team, she was asked once more to attend Ohio, and she sat down to see if she would take up this opportunity. She still didn’t know where Ohio was.</p>
        
        <p>Johnstone decided to take the risk, even though she never met the head coach or visited the campus. She arrived a week into preseason practice.</p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/3e5ab435-8a60-4404-a0b1-748d719e51be.sized-1000x1000.jpg" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">photographers name | FOR THE POST</p><p class="pcut">image description here</p> </div>
        
        <br><br>
        
        <p>Even after deciding to come to Athens, she was not planning to stay for long.</p>
        
        <p>“I planned on one (year),” Johnstone said. “And I stayed for four and loved it.”</p>
        
        <p>Johnstone came to Athens with no goals other than to have a different experience. She eventually became one of the best players in Ohio history and was the first Bobcat to be named the Mid-American Conference Player of the Year.</p>
        
        <p>After four years, Johnstone had the most assists in Ohio history and was third all-time in total points. She was on the MAC Championship title team in 2001, the third ever for the Bobcats. That championship began a stretch of five titles in 11 years.</p>
        
        <p>She was a regional All-American three times and was inducted into the Kermit Blosser Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame in 2011.</p>
        
        <p>Johnstone then went on to play for the Canadian National Team, playing in 39 matches. She spent one year in the German Premier Division.</p>
        
        <p>She coached in Canada for three years until an assistant coaching job opened at Ohio in 2009.</p>
        
        <p>Coaching as a full-time profession excited Johnstone. In Canada, that’s not possible.</p>
        
        <p>“You don't really make enough to support a family, let alone yourself, in coaching,” Johnstone said. “And the fact that we can do that here is just, it blows my mind, and I feel extremely lucky.</p>
        
        <p>Ohio had immediate success when Johnstone returned; it won the MAC Championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. In Johnstone’s second and final year in her first stint, the team advanced to the MAC title game but fell to Miami.</p>
        
        <p>After her second season, a new opportunity arose for Johnstone to coach at Northwestern and continue moving toward her goal of becoming a head coach.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="pq_right">“It's just being all on the same mind frame of championship mind instead of a fear of losing, or a fear of winning sometimes.”<span class="attribution">Ali Johnstone</span></blockquote>
        
        <p>“I mean that's why I left here, (it) was to go gain more experience and different experience,” Johnstone said. “I gained a lot of experience, and that was because I want to be a head coach.”</p>
        
        <p>Coaching under Tracey Fuchs, she helped build Northwestern into one of the best teams in the country, reaching as high as eighth in the rankings last season. Fuchs is one of the top field hockey minds in the country and was elected to the USA Field Hockey Hall of Fame in 2014.</p>
        
        <p>Johnstone coached at Northwestern for seven seasons. She was an assistant for four of them. She helped the team reach the NCAA Tournament twice.</p>
        
        <p>Being an assistant coach has prepared Johnstone for what it takes to be a head coach at a Division I program.</p>
        
        <p>“It takes many, many years of being an assistant to understand the handlings of what the head coaches go through,” Johnstone said.</p>
        
        <p>The spring season was about learning who the players at her disposal are and implementing a strategy for the team. With the seniors graduated, the team is small, which has allowed her to work with each player individually.</p>
        
        <p>“I don't think hockey's rocket science, so there's not going to be reinventing the wheel,” Johnstone said. “It's just being all on the same mind frame of championship mind instead of a fear of losing, or a fear of winning sometimes.”</p>
        
        <p>Upcoming senior Kendall Ballard is the standout player. She already has 21 career goals. The difficulty Johnstone has is finding other players to take the scoring load off Ballard and force opposition to plan for others.</p>
        
        <p>There will be more experience on this year’s team, with four freshmen starting almost every game this past season. Two were on defense.</p>
        
        <p>Each time Johnstone has been in Athens, the Bobcats have won a MAC Championship. It won’t be easy this time, as Kent State and Miami have been atop the conference since the last Ohio title in 2011.</p>
        
        <p>Twenty years ago, Johnstone did not know where Ohio was on a map. Now, she is the head field hockey coach at Ohio and knows her way around Athens with ease.</p>
        
        <p>“It was almost too perfect, it's crazy,” Johnstone said. “Most spouses probably say, ‘Athens, where?’ But no, my wife was, ‘Yes, please! Can we go home now?" And I said, ‘Yes, of course.’”</p>
