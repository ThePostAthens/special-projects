        <!-- CONTENT GOES BELOW HERE -->
        <p>On July 1, 2014, Sara Legarsky sat in her apartment in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and filled out a job application. She filled it to the brim with references and her resume from past positions, including her time spent at Oklahoma State.</p>
        
        <p>It only took two days for Legarsky to get a response back about the opening for a director of media relations position at Ohio. A phone interview on the third that led to a flight on the sixth brought Legarsky to Athens for the first time. It wouldn’t be her last.</p>
        
         <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ohi/916e1e7e-f235-4946-8e72-cffcaf59209d.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt="Sara Legarsky" style="width: 100%"> <p class="photog">Blake Nissen | PHOTO EDITOR</p><p class="pcut">Ohio Sports Information Director, Sara Legarsky, poses for a portrait in the Convo on March 5.</p> </div>
        
        <p>Legarsky was formally offered the position as a Director of Media Relations at Ohio on July 7, and, in the span of 23 days, she filled her life into a U-Haul and started out on a new journey.</p>
        
        <p>“It was overwhelming,” Legarsky said. “I spent 14 hours in car from and drove from Stillwater to Indianapolis and then to Athens.”</p>
        
        <p>She lived in a Hampton Inn for a week, where she had chips and salsa for her first meal.</p>
        
        <p>Legarsky juggled the stress of both personally and professionally with little time to actually do so. No longer in the graduate assistant role, and with departures elsewhere on staff early in her time at Ohio, Legarsky was forced into a professional maturation.</p>
        
        <p>Her first task? To be the main media contact for the Bobcats football team.</p>
        
        <p>“It was a terrible first two months,” Legarsky said. “Like, you’re just like, ‘I’m going to be running a Division I football program.’ ”</p>
        
        <p>As she paved her way into the business, Legarsky never thought of the barriers she was breaking along the way. A retroactive thinker, Legarsky lives life in the moment, and in those quiet hours to herself, she reflects upon the day she had just lived out.</p>
        
        <p>Being a woman in a male-dominated field, Legarsky has gone through and experienced subtle forms of oppression, or a surprised-to-see-you-here moment, most notably in the start of her career.</p>
        
        <p>“The struggle I had would be when TV crews would come in and be like, ‘Hey, where’s the SID?’ ” Legarsky said. “I’d be like, ‘It’s me,’ and they would laugh at me.’ Another time, at football practice, I had a student worker who was a male and people would come up to him thinking he’s the SID and he would just point to me.”</p>
        
        <p>Fellow sports information director, Mike Ashcraft has worked alongside Legarsky since her start at Ohio and he too has noticed the struggle that women face.</p>
        
        <p>“I think men sometimes question whether this person in legit or not,” Ashcraft said. “Can they really do this job? I just think that's unfair to make that assumption just because you're a woman, you know?”</p>
        
        <p>As Ohio’s lone woman SID for the past four years, Legarsky has noticed that over time, her gender became less of the topic and the athletes — or, as she calls them, “my kids” — became the focus. Legarsky thinks that’s the way it should be.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:500;font-size:30px;">***</p>
        
        <p>A native of Indiana, Pennsylvania, a suburb a little more than an hour away from Pittsburgh, Legarksy’s life has always been sport-centric.</p>
        
        <p>Legarsky saw the former confines of the Pirates and Penguins, Three Rivers Stadium and Mellon Arena, respectively, many times as a Pittsburgh fan. At times in which both franchises were at low points — the Pirates hadn’t made the playoffs since 1992 and the financially plagued Penguins couldn’t sell tickets to their own games — Legarsky still holds those times near and dear.</p>
        
        <p>“Growing up outside of Pittsburgh, sports were always a big part,” Legarsky said. “On Sundays, you were watching football, you were watching the Pirates, you were watching the Penguins.”</p>
        
        <p>Especially when she witnessed a former Pirate play one of his oddest games in a return to Pittsburgh.</p>
        
        <p>“One year, my dad and I got tickets to see the Pirates play, and they played the Giants while Barry Bonds was still playing,” Legarsky said. “He went out to left field, misread a fly ball and the outfield just started taunting him; then, two innings later, he was up to bat, and he swung and missed so hard he fell over.”</p>
        
        <p>With a sports fandom like no other — as well as an athletic career as softball player through high school — Legarsky couldn’t abandon one of her life pillars, and so, as an undergraduate student, at St. Bonaventure, Legarsky started to lie down the foundation of her career.</p>
        
        <p>In pursuit of a bachelors in journalism and mass communications through a public relations concentration, Legarksy got her start as a sophomore working in the athletic department at St. Bonaventure.</p>
        
        <p>“I wrote my first few recaps about the cross country team and then was handed swimming and diving,” Legarsky said. “That was pretty cool, and I had it for the next three years. I got to run the (Atlantic 10) Championships in Buffalo.”</p>
        
        <p>When the time came to say goodbye to Bonaventure, Legarsky was taken aback by a simple realization: She didn’t have a job.</p>
        
        <p>Scouring the nation for an opportunity, it came 1,206 miles away in Stillwater as a graduate assistant at Oklahoma State.</p>
        
        <p>“When I got hired at Oklahoma State, I was told that I was the first woman to be working the athletic department in 20 years,” Legarsky said.</p>
        
        <p>Legarsky left the east coast behind and moved to a college town in the midwest where the transition was a struggle for Legarsky.</p>
        
        <p>Amid the struggle, Legarsky thrived in her first year at Oklahoma State as the media contact for the Cowboys men’s cross country team. That team won a national title that stirred jokes among the other members of the media team.</p>
        
        <p>“I have a national title tied to my name,” Legarsky said. “Everyone was joking, they’re like, ‘You literally just rolled in and win a national title, like you can’t really go up you can only go down.’”</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately for Legarsky, she’s only continued to soar. When her time was nearing an end and with no open positions, she started to look for a new home. She found it in Athens.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:500;font-size:30px;">***</p>
        
        <p>With time and experience in the workforce building every day, Legarksy is a symbol of the future for women in the sports world.</p>
        
        <p>“One thing I will say is she's a great advocate for the sports that she works with,” Ashcraft said. “She works with soccer or women's basketball, softball and women's golf. She's really passionate about what she does.”</p>
        
        <blockquote class="pq_center">“I want to see this field grow with women because there are plenty of women out there who know plenty about sports."<span class="attribution">- Sara Legarsky, Ohio Sports Information Director</span></blockquote>
        
        <p>With multiple female graduate assistants and Meagan Hogan, the director of marketing for Ohio, Legarsky is witness to the change of a male-dominated field, to a more even playing ground.</p>
        
        <p>“I want to see this field grow with women because there are plenty of women out there who know plenty about sports,” Legarsky said. “It’s 2018, we are past the conversations of, ‘Oh, you know so much about sports!’ If you like sports, (then) you like sports — gender doesn’t matter. I love my job; waking up on Monday morning is easy.”</p>
