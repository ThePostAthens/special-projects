        <p>A majority of the travel teams at a tournament in &bull;Easton had a strategy &mdash; put the best players they had on the ice and dominate the scoreboard.</p>

        <p>Athens Mite league player &bull;Tanner Altop didn&rsquo;t care about the hefty competition ahead of him because coach put him in as a goalie &mdash; his favorite position. </p>

        <p>The &bull;Athens Mite league has had its fair share of losses and is known as the little guy of Ohio hockey. But not many players in the league cared about the wins because the ice was another place to be with friends. They all got ice time, passed the puck and with some finesse, they scored a goal. </p>

        <p>During the &bull;third game of the tournament in &bull;Columbus and with some help from his teammates, Tanner ended up with &bull;44 saves that game. Even though the team still ended up losing to the &bull;Cleveland Barons by &bull;seven goals, it was the best game of his hockey career.</p>

        <p>Tanner doesn&rsquo;t have a particular strategy or method to playing hockey &mdash; he&rsquo;s &bull;8 years old. </p>

        <p>The &bull;Athens Youth Hockey Association recruited him at age &bull;4 and strapped a pair of hand-me-down skates on him. There are always opportunities for hockey equipment and ice time for children who wander in &bull;Bird Arena. </p>
        
        <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/17140_tinyhockey_2f.jpg"><p class="photog">Emily Matthews</p><p class="pcut">The Athens Mite and Mini-Mite hockey teams play in Bird Arena on Jan. 21, 2017.</p></div>

        <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a first-time skater, there&rsquo;s gear for you here,&rdquo; said &bull;Phil Oberlin, coach for the &bull;Mites (&bull;8 and under) and &bull;Mini-Mites (&bull;6 and under) leagues. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about getting them out on the ice, inciting passion and having fun.&rdquo; </p>

        <h2 class="subhed">The league</h2>
        
        <div class="hr">
            <p>Mini-Mite: 6 and under</p>
            <p>Mites: 8 and under</p>
            <p>Squirt: 10 and under</p>
            <p>PeeWee: 12 and under</p>
            <p>Bantam: 14 and under</p>
            <p>Athens High School: junior varsity and varsity</p>

        </div>

        <p>The &bull;100 members of the Athens Youth Hockey Association (between ages &bull;4-18) skate and plummet on the &bull;same sheet of ice as &bull;the Bobcats. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Youth hockey has been around forever,&rdquo; Oberlin said. &ldquo;The rink is on the heart of campus.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The Athens hockey culture is strong despite not having too many players. Unlike in &bull;Columbus and &bull;Cleveland that have &bull;handfuls of &bull;ice rinks, southeast Ohio doesn&rsquo;t have another rink for about &bull;95 miles. Some youth players travel from &bull;West Virginia to play in a league. </p>

        <p>The Mite division, which consists of &bull;12 players, only has one team in Athens. All divisions are &bull;coed. The Cleveland Barons, the team the Mites played at the Easton Tournament the weekend of &bull;Jan. 14 had &bull;nine teams for &bull;one age group, so about &bull;90 players. </p>

        <p>The &bull;54-year-old association credits its ability to compete with other cities to its recruiting tactics, said Oberlin who is also the head coach of &bull;Ohio hockey &bull;Division II. The focus on keeping enrollment high is a constant struggle by letting people know hockey is an affordable option in Athens.</p>

            Elbow pads
            Hockey pants
            Gloves
            Shin pads
            Skates

        <p>Before each game and practice at Bird Arena, a &bull;dozen bins are set outside the locker rooms &mdash; &bull;pads, &bull;socks, &bull;practice jerseys, &bull;skates, helmets and hockey &bull;sticks to name a few. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Hockey can get pretty expensive, especially with more than one kid,&rdquo; &bull;Brandy Altop said. She signs out hockey gear provided by the association for both her children to use. </p>

        <p>Hockey culture can be intimidating &mdash; the lingo, the gear and travel costs are daunting. After adding the total costs of equipment and the fees to play, most parents are out the door looking for the community center&rsquo;s basketball sign-up sheet instead, Brandy said. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so great about the division leagues and the learn-to-play hockey programs is parents may only have to pay for the club fee and borrow the gear that people donate after their kid has grown out of it,&rdquo; Oberlin said. </p>

        <p>Jack&bull; Amos, &bull;8, borrows plenty of equipment from the association. He doesn&rsquo;t mind. What he does own is his signature candy apple red helmet for all to see. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I like how it&rsquo;s different than everyone else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People know it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; </p>

        <h2 class="subhed">Learning to play</h2>

        <p>Oberlin grew up involved in the &bull;Athens Youth Hockey Association and graduated &bull;Athens High School playing varsity hockey. He found himself back at the association volunteering for &bull;two leagues and &bull;learn-to-play hockey programs in addition to &bull;coaching the Ohio hockey Division II team. </p>

        <p>As Oberlin gives back to the association, he tries to make volunteering as painless as possible for parents &mdash; something fun to do with their children. </p>

        <p>Caleb&bull; Amos, father to Jack, had never played hockey in his youth, and now he is volunteering to help at his son&rsquo;s games and practices. Hockey was never in his family, but when Jack brought home a flier about &ldquo;Learn to Play Hockey,&rdquo; they both decided to learn more.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of strange and fun to help out &mdash; all of them crazy on the ice all the time,&rdquo; Caleb said. </p>

        <p>Oberlin said it&rsquo;s funny to see parents shuffling on the ice at first, making sure they don&rsquo;t wipe out. They help direct players by &bull;skating with them or moving the team &bull;on and off the ice between plays. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;We have a joke it&rsquo;s like herding cats,&rdquo; Oberlin said.</p>

        <p>Jack likes having his dad help out during the games, but he likes skating <strong>&nbsp;&mdash; </strong>and falling<strong> &mdash;</strong> with his friends on the ice even more.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I fell 1,000 times on the ice, but then I learned to love it,&rdquo; Jack said. </p>

        <h2 class="subhed">Money honey</h2>

        <p>The &bull;Mite Midwinter House League, a learn-to-play program designed for players to &bull;scrimmage each other, had been axed about &bull;20 years ago due to low enrollment and money, but was reinstated in &bull;December 2016. Oberlin believes it will be another tool for players of varying skills to learn to love hockey and to join a division. </p>

        <p>When players, such as &bull;Zoe and &bull;Tanner, signed up for Mini-Mite and Mite leagues fees &bull;included the &bull;Mite Midwinter House League, which has &bull;30 players. </p>

        <p>The 30 children enrolled are &bull;varying skill levels. Some had been in the division leagues and others have just learned to skate. </p>

        <p>The Mite Midwinter House League was &bull;reinstated due to the partial use of a &bull;$9,600 grant from the &bull;Columbus Blue Jackets Foundation. Over the past &bull;16 years, the foundation has donated &bull;$64,000 to the association. This year, the foundation also donated &bull;two jerseys to each player in the league. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;The Blue Jackets Foundation is committed to supporting the development of youth and amateur hockey and removing barriers to play our great sport,&rdquo; &bull;Kathryn Dobbs, &bull;executive director of the &bull;Columbus Blue Jackets Foundation, said in an email. &ldquo;(Athens Youth Hockey Association) has been a longtime grant partner of ours because they are equally committed to advancing our mission and growing the game in southeast Ohio.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2 class="subhed">THE LOVE</h2>
        
        <div class="oneimg_right"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ohi/17138_tinyhockey_1f.jpg"><p class="photog">Emily Matthews</p><p class="pcut">Clockwise from top, Wally Meek, Corbin Patton, and Tanner Altop stumble for the puck during the The Athens Mite and Mini-Mite hockey games on Jan. 21, 2017.</p></div>

        <p>The day after the tournament in Easton, Tanner was at hockey practice with his friends playing freeze tag and sliding on the ice. The &bull;only win they had at the tournament wasn&rsquo;t forgotten, but it wasn&rsquo;t overtly glorified. </p>

        <p>The players love scoring goals, but to them the goals do not equate to winning. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I like defense because I get to smash people,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty strong.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Most times at Bird Arena, players are ready in their gear, pounding on the glass to win the attention of the &bull;Zamboni driver. He honks at them. A clever player rallies a chant of, &ldquo;Let us out,&rdquo; because the players were eagerly awaiting their scrimmage. It's &bull;9 a.m. on a Saturday &mdash; most of the OU campus is dead. </p>

        <p>Crowded at the door, skaters funnel onto the ice aimlessly circling each other. It's what the professionals do except with more falling down. </p>

        <p>No matter the travel time in the car, or how tired players may be for practice, their burdens are forgotten when they go on the ice, Brandy said. To her, it&rsquo;s worth it to involve her children in hockey. She &bull;participated in the Athens Youth Hockey Association and loved it. She wanted to give her children the same experience. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how our numbers are going up because people my age who were in the program are not having kids and introducing their kids to hockey,&rdquo; Oberlin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty neat cycle.&rdquo; </p>
