    <p class="intro">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span>pening weekend on campus can be an exciting time: meeting new people, going to parties, staying out all night. With no parents around, it can be an overwhelming feeling for students with deciding what rules they want to make. However, it’s imperative to stay safe on campus.</p>

        <p>Last year, sexual assault reports seemed <a href="https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/12/rape-report-ohio-university-police-department-sane">higher than ever</a> on campus, so it’s important to be looking out for signs of harassment and being mindful of the truth about sexual assault while out on campus. Here are some things to keep in mind when it comes to staying safe:</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Do some research</h2></div>
        <p>Here’s the hard truth about college: sexual assault happens. The number of rape reports on campus last year was not only higher than ever on Ohio University’s campus, but it was higher <a href="https://thenewpolitical.com/2018/10/04/ohio-universitys-sexual-assault-rates-are-higher-than-other-ohio-schools/">than any other Ohio college</a>. Whether that’s a case of more people feeling confident enough to come forward thanks to the #MeToo movement, or if there were actually more rapes on campus, is unclear.</p>
        <p>According to a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/studyg/rape.html">study from PBS</a>, three-fourths of victims know their rapists. In another article by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/09/26/ohio-university-sexual-assault-rape-culture-campus/1424931002/">USA Today</a>, it’s found that more than half of college sexual assaults annually take place between August and November. What’s even worse is 54 percent of rape cases <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/50-facts-rape_b_2019338">aren’t even reported</a>. There are <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-sexual-assault">so many facts</a> about sexual assault and rape that are important to know, and they should be researched before going out and enjoying night life on campus.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Have a buddy</h2></div>
        <p>One of the best ways to stay safe: always keep a buddy around. There’s strength in numbers, so two friends can look after each other while going out. If one friend is being sexually harassed, the other friend can <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/sexual-harassment-what-to-do-how-to-help/">step in</a> and directly intervene, or cause a distraction to get the friend out of the situation. </p>
        <p>Having a friend increases chances of safety by a lot, not only from intervening in times of crisis but also by having someone trustworthy around to make sure nothing bad happens. Even if one person is separated from the friend, they can, at least, act as a person who has information about where the person last was before they were separated, what they had to drink and personal information like where they live and who they are.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Keep track of what is in the drink and where the drink is from</h2></div>
        <p>No matter what age a student is, it’s likely they’ll go out and drink at a party at some point. Especially if it’s their first weekend in Athens, it can be exciting to have the opportunity to go out and get drunk with a bunch of friends without any parental supervision to spoil the fun. However, keeping track of what’s in the drink and where the drink comes from is essential. This can be the determining factor of how a night ends, and there are multiple negative scenarios that can come from going overboard or not paying attention.</p>
        <p>First off, beware of what’s in the drink, especially if it’s a drink purchased or found while out at a party. If someone else makes the drink and the person isn’t paying attention to what’s in it, it could prove to be harmful.</p>
        <p>Next, it’s important to know where the drink comes from. If a person doesn’t personally watch their drink be made, not only will they have no clue what’s in it alcohol-wise, but they won’t know if the drink has been <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320409.php">roofied</a> or tampered with. Someone could serve a drink that will completely mess up a person’s head or memory of the evening, and they could potentially be harmed. It’s essential to know where the drink came from and what is being put into it.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Know how to get help</h2></div>
        <p>Before going out and getting into a potentially harmful situation, not only is it important to know general facts and statistics about rape and sexual assault, but it’s important to research area emergency information. Where is the Athens police station? Where is the campus police station? Where are the blue emergency stations around campus? What are the numbers to call in case of emergencies? </p>
        <p>Staying safe is much more important than getting caught doing drugs or drinking, so rather than fearing potential consequences of drinking underage or doing drugs, focus on calling for help if it means helping someone else or saving a life. Some police departments and colleges, like the <a href="https://conduct.students.wisc.edu/responsible-action-guidelines/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, even have a system where if someone is underage drinking, but call to report a crime, they will be safe from any consequences because they were responsible by reporting.</p>
        <div><h2 class="subhed">Don't go crazy</h2></div>
        <p>It’s the first weekend back to school, and while it can bring fun and a great time, it also welcomes trouble. It’s in everyone’s best interest to avoid going overboard with drinking an excessive amount and being unable to handle oneself or their friends. A good way to combat getting into a bad situation would be to have a strong knowledge of facts and of necessary information needed in case of an emergency.</p>
        <p>All in all, it comes down to being smart and safe. Everything in college seems exaggerated, from the academic freedoms and financial freedoms to students creating their own sets of rules. If students pay attention to the facts, stick together in groups, keep track of what they’re drinking or consuming, know how to get help in the area and don’t go overboard with their partying, odds are they’ll be safe. </p>
        <p>If you or someone you know have experienced sexual assault and need someone to reach out to, call 740-591-4266 to contact the Southeast Ohio Survivor Advocacy Outreach Program.</p>
        <p>To contact the Ohio University Police Department, call 911 in an emergency or 740-593-1911.</p>
        <p>To contact the Athens Police Department, call 911 in an emergency, 740-593-6606 or 740-592-3313.</p>
