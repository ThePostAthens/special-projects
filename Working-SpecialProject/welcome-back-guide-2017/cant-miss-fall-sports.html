    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every year thousands of fans fill Chessa and Pruitt fields, Peden Stadium and The Convo to see Ohio&rsquo;s fall sports programs compete in their respective sports. Each season comes with games and events that Bobcat fans don&rsquo;t want to miss. Here are a few to look out for, complete with tentative start times and dates (for the complete fall schedule check out the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.ohiobobcats.com/landing/index">Ohio Bobcats athletic homepage</a>).</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v. <font color="red">Miami</font> (Football), Oct. 31, Kickoff TBA</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The annual &ldquo;Battle of the Bricks&rdquo; returns to Peden Stadium this year, and it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">an event that the Bobcat faithful show out for in full force. Last season the Bobcats stole the game from the RedHawks and <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/10/battle-of-the-bricks">won 17-7 in Oxford.</a> After last season&rsquo;s game that featured only 435 combined total yards, this year will be sure to feature another chippy game against Ohio&rsquo;s most notorious rival. Coincidentally, this game also follows HallOUweekend, so any Miami friends you have might just sleep in your dorm room or apartment for an extended stay.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v. <font color="maroon">Central Michigan</font> (Football), Oct. 7, Kickoff TBA</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another word in which I can insert &ldquo;OU&rdquo; and have it still make sense: hOUmecoming. The </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bobcats will look to give Ohio alumni the gift of victory as they play Central Michigan. Ohio dropped last year&rsquo;s bout against <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/11/ohio-loses-to-central">Central Michigan, 27-20</a>. Nonetheless, this year Ohio looks to exact revenge on its own turf in front of Bobcats both old and new.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Bobcat Invitational</font> (Volleyball), Sept. 1-2, All Day</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Bobcats volleyball team hosts the Bobcat Invitational this year, which will bring</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Power 5 schools Oklahoma and Georgia to campus. Fun fact: OU comes to OU, and the University of Georgia is in Athens, Georgia. Last season, <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/09/volleyball-ohio-set-for-final-non-conference-matches">Ohio traveled to Norman, Oklahoma, to participate in the NIKE Invitational</a>, an invitational that didn&rsquo;t go so hot for the Bobcats, who went 1-2 at the invitational. But that was then and this is now. A young, inexperienced team took the court last year but showed promise towards the end of the year.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="green">Eastern Michigan</font> (Soccer), Sept. 22, 4 p.m.</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pitch at Chessa Field on Ohio&rsquo;s athletic side of campus (on West Green) saw many games in the 2016-17 campaign that were close all the way to the end but fell the other way, resulting in a Bobcat loss. After going 3-8 in conference play last season, the Bobcats look to start on the right foot (or left, depending on who&rsquo;s dribbling) in their Mid-American Conference home/season opener against the Eagles of Eastern Michigan. After dropping last season&rsquo;s bout 2-0 in Ypsilanti, the Bobcats will look to be on the other end of those close games, with more offensive production in the first half and sharper defense in the closing minutes of the match.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="red">Miami</font>, <font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="orange">Bowling Green</font> (Volleyball), Sept. 29-30, 7 p.m. (both days)</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While the team starts conference play on the road (against Buffalo and Akron), Ohio opens up home conference play against in-state rivals Miami and Bowling Green. Starting off with Miami on the 29th, Ohio returns a more experienced team for this season. Looking to avenge a 3-0 shutout in Oxford last season, the Bobcats bring back all the tools necessary to steal a win against the MAC Tournament runner-up. The next day, the Falcons swept into Athens looking to do what the Bobcats will try to do against the RedHawks: exact revenge. With a 3-0 win over Bowling Green last season in the Stroh Center, it&rsquo;ll be sure to make for a good contest between both Ohio MAC schools.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="blue">Kansas</font> (Football), Sept. 16, Kickoff 2 p.m.</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to see a Big 12 school play a football game but never have wanted to go out west, you&rsquo;re in luck. The Kansas Jayhawks come to Athens in mid-September in a Power 5 versus Group 5 Division I football game. Last season the Bobcats took a trip to Memorial Stadium in Lawrence, Kansas, and <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2016/09/ohio-kansas-game-story">waltzed away with a victory behind former quarterback Greg Windham's stellar performance</a>. Traditionally, Kansas isn&rsquo;t one of the most dominant football programs in the country, but it is a member of one of the most historically talented conferences in the Big 12. With a 2 p.m. kickoff, there&rsquo;s more than enough of a Saturday to hang out at Peden Stadium and still have a night out in Athens.</p>
<div><h2 class="subhed"><font color="#acca88">Ohio Senior Games</font></h2></div>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="navy">Toledo</font> (Soccer), Oct. 22, 1 p.m.</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For the seven seniors on the Bobcats soccer team, this will be their last match at Chessa Field. A close game ensued last season between the two teams at Lynn Stadium in Toledo. With a 1-1 tie at halftime, the Bobcats couldn&rsquo;t find a way to put one in the back of the net. Toledo, however, did and ultimately won the match 2-1. But with seven seniors on the pitch at one time, a collective experience and chemistry could get Ohio some wins this season, including against Toledo.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="navy">Toledo</font> (Football), Nov. 8, Kickoff TBA</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Much like the soccer team, last season the Bobcats were in a close game with Toledo. The difference being that the Bobcats came out on top and won 31-26. This season 18 seniors will sport the green and white one last time in Peden Stadium. With an 8-6 record last season, the Bobcats are looking to once again make an appearance in the MAC Championship Game come December.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><font color="green">Ohio</font> v <font color="maroon">Central Michigan</font> (Volleyball), Sept. 11, 7 p.m.</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though the Bobcats are still a young team, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t come without experience. Yet, they have only one senior on the team: Ali Lake, a middle-backer from Liberty Township. Lake, a redshirt senior, has spent the last five years playing for the Bobcats and has gone through the ups and downs that are typical in collegiate volleyball. Last season the Bobcats lost 3-2 against the Chippewas in a close match in each set. With all of that youth returning, the Bobcats have the potential to compete with anyone in the conference this season.</p>
