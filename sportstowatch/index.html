                <h3>Chelsea vs. Arsenal</h3>
                <h5>Sept. 19, 2015</h5>
                <p>The reigning champ of the 2014-15 EPL title, Chelsea, should not take this game lightly against Arsenal. The Gunners caught fire during a late season surge to fight for a second-place finish. They ended up third and former champion, Manchester City, took second. This year, I believe Arsenal has what it takes to keep the title in London. If it weren’t for Chelsea’s unbelievable start to the Premier League and Arsenal’s mediocre start last season, the season could have changed vastly with these two teams going back and forth up until the final whistle. </p>

                <h3>Everton v Liverpool</h3>
                <h5>Oct. 3, 2015</h5>
                <p>“The Merseyside Derby.” In the first leg at Anfield, the Kop was silenced by a 92nd minute 25-yard volley from Everton defender Phil Jagielka to seal a 1-1 draw. In the reverse fixture it was a scoreless trench fight that saw the two sides again produce a single point each.</p>
                <p>Liverpool had an interesting season with forward Daniel Sturridge missing most of the season and falling apart early on making a few appearances in the bottom half of the table. But a mid-season turnaround saw the Reds get back up to a Euro League. Everton also had an inconsistent season, staying mainly in the bottom half of the table. Hopefully a better start to the season can put the Toffees back in the Euro League spot Everton fans are used to seeing the club in.</p>

                <h3>Sunderland vs. Norwich City</h3>
                <h5>Aug. 15, 2015</h5>
                <p>The last time these two teams met in 2014, Norwich City’s Alexander Tettey hit an absolute screamer to give Norwich a 2-0 lead over Sunderland in its fight to stay up. Unfortunately, an unlucky draw of the last four games put them in the Football League Championship, England’s second tier. A year later, the Canaries outlasted the promotion Play-Off and have returned to England’s top league. Even though this matchup is early in the season, it will have just as much meaning now as it did back in March 2014. If Norwich can start strong early, it should avoid relegation and become a consistent EPL team.</p>

                <h3>Newcastle United vs. Aston Villa</h3>
                <h5>Dec. 19, 2015</h5>
                <p>These two teams escaped relegation—and I mean escaped. If it wasn’t for a Hull City team that crumbled game-after-game, Villa would’ve had their first exposure to life below the Premier League. As for Newcastle United, it was midfielder Jonas Gutierrez, who was recovering from testicular cancer, who punched the Magpies ticket to remain in the EPL. Ironically, the club released within a week after the last match via telephone. These two teams simply struggled. Both had decent starts last year, but found themselves creeping lower and lower down the table before almost finding themselves in the relegation zone. Maybe if they flip script and finish strong, they can get the relegation thoughts out of the critics and fans’ minds.</p>

                <h3>Southampton vs. Arsenal</h3>
                <h5>December 26 (Boxing Day)</h5>
                <p>Southampton was the surprise team last year, selling most of its players away and relying on its youth to carry the weight. And to the surprise of many it worked. Minus some slip-ups late in the season, it was back and forth between Tottenham and Southampton trying to chase down Liverpool for the final Euro League spot. Arsenal is my favorite to win the title this year and this will not be an easy game for them. Just a day after Christmas, soccer fans are given one more present in a day full of soccer.</p>
